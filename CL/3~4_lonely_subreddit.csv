fpmwk0,Trying to make friends,"Hi everyone , hope you're all doing well with the quarentine. I'm a 16 yo spanish student trying to get rid of his social anxiety , I'm just sick of it and I've decided that I need to break off the shell , I just have such a hard time at school I barely have anyone to talk to and most times during lunch I just hide in the bathroom and eat my food there because I'm scared of engaging a conversation with other people , I have really good grades so I'm often called to go to the broad , and when that happens... I just lose it and my hands starts quivering and sweating like hell, I can feel like people make fun of me behind my back and that really gets me down sometimes I have only one friend at school.So I've decided that it's enough , I have to make a change in my life and stop being so socially awkward , I know that if I don't do something about it, it will affect me in the future one of my dad's friends offered me a job at a restaurant he owns and I really need the money and the laboral experience however I can't bring myself up to it. I'm tired of this , so I thought chatting with people who feel the same way I do could help out , if you're stuck in a similar situation feel free to add me on discord (Edm#7222) maybe we can do something about it",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fpmwk0/trying_to_make_friends/,kessll,1,2020-03-27 09:15:03,0,/r/lonely/comments/fpmwk0/trying_to_make_friends/,NaN
fpn8yx,I'm desperate,"I have applied to some universities in the US, public and private ones. And guess what, out of 12 universities I applied to, no one accepted me at all. Lol. I cried yes because now I think I won't be able to pursue college anymore. I can't afford college tuition in our country that's why I thought of applying to universities in the US thinking that they offer free education.

I'm 18yo, my experiences are only limited. I have worked at McDonald's for hardly 4 months when I was 16 and I'm working as a customer service representative for 2 months  now.

fpne19,I try so hard but I keep getting hurt,"I just want to end it, I want to so badly, I’m trying so hard but my life is just horrible- what’s the point in living when everything is so unfair...I help everyone out as much as I can, I give my love and support to the people that need it but in the end...they all leave me...being at home and being yelled at constantly for very small things has fucked up my mind, I’m so stressed and it seems like death is the thing that’ll make it all better...but i can’t.

fpnz2k,I’ve been that one weird/“sped” kid that everyone avoids or makes fun of my entire life,"I’m in high school and I’ve moved around a bit but wherever I go, there I am, and everyone still thinks I’m sped, so it’s not because of a pre-existing shitty environment that everyone thinks I’m some sort of sped, it’s all on me I think

Doesn’t help that social stuff just isn’t something I _get_ where it seems to be instinctual easy shit for everyone else

On top of that the most real friends I’ve ever had at a time was like 3, and I have social anxiety (diagnosed) because I’m not sure if I’m ever acting “correctly” in a setting with other people around or in a conversation, and a lot of people have pretended to be my friend and then turned around to backstab me after getting enough info from me (and I don’t even know if it’s something I did to deserve it somehow because everyone seems to hate me but I have no clue what I’m doing wrong)

Starting from when I was little I didn’t have like normal person “hobbies” but instead I had weird obsessions with different things

Now I have nobody to talk to, all my old friends and “friends” are “busy” during coronacation (and I can’t blame them because I’m boring and weird and paranoid so why would they talk to me)

fpo0bb,I'm so done.,"I've had enough. I've felt like this for way too long.


Gonna cut to the chase and jump back to September 2017, when I started a new high school for Year 10 (UK education system). I was 14 going 15, and had a fresh start along with everyone else, since they were taking Year 10 and above on board. Previously I hadn't really had a friendship group to hang with, so when I found people there I was so happy. I finally had people I could hang with. I finally had people I could open up to, be myself to, chill with. I was invited to outings. I had classmates. I had pals that would actually check up on me. I loved it.


Around February to March, 2018: someone in the group introduces this guy, from this point on I'll call him 'M'. I had talked to M a few times, but not enough to actually know him. We all thought he was a little strange at first, but gave him a chance. So, he sat with us, and became part of the group. Normal, right?

...right?


Somewhere around late-May to early-June, 2018: M starts to be a bit of a dick to me. I shrugged it off, as I thought ""Hey, maybe it's a rough patch he's going theough"" or ""Hey, maybe that's his sense of humour"". Oh, how wrong I was.


August, 2018: we're all on our summer break. M invites everyone in our group chat out, which meant me as well. Or, at least I thought. We hadn't gone out in a week or two, so I thought that this would be a cool time to chill. We go to an abandoned construction zone, and the majority of us have drinks. Except me and someone else in the group. Not as a ""party pooper"" kinda thing, just that I wasn't fond of the whole drinking and smoking thing at the time.

As I'm leaving, M is walking me back, and says ""Thanks for coming, even though you weren't invited."" I laughed it off, but remembered that. I knew he said that for a reason, and that proved right months later.

From that point, no one discussed meetups in the group chat, but there'd still be the group hanging out on Snapchat stories, doing funny and stupid shit. Without me.


November, 2018: two months into Year 11, and I hadn't been invited out again since the August hangout. I still sat in their group, but none of them asked if I wanted to go anywhere, or anything. They were discussing going out to a light festival that night, and I wasn't aware until one of the kids WHO ISN'T EVEN IN THE GROUP mentioned it in front of me, to which I asked about it. He said it wasn't much, just seeing what it was like, making it seem little. Later that same day, I overheard in the group ""How are we going to split the bill"", ""Who has fake ID"", etc. At this point, I don't know how to feel. Once I'm on my way home, I message the group asking why there were plans that didn't have my attention. Not aggressively, I simply said ""Are there plans without me?"" To which, I got responses such as ""TA_done you fucking idiot they were, we told you"", ""stop causing drama TA_done"", ""if you kick off about something so small I will literally rape your cat"". I stayed quiet, and watched the insults flood in. The morning after, they all left the group chat, and made a new one. Without me. How do I know? Well...


February, 2019: ...I know because throughout this time there are more meetups without my knowledge, more ""Check out this meme in the group chat"" which I clearly wasn't in, more of everything, without me. It took me up to this point, up to February to finally give up trying to keep in their friendship group. I sat alone. Up til June when my Year 11 exams finished and we left, I sat alone. No one to talk to me, to invite me out, to ask ""Hey TA_done, doing anything at the weekend?"", to ask about my feelings. Alone.


September, 2019: I start sixth form (aka college) alone, a new start to Year 12. Or so, I thought.

My sixth form doesn't have many people in, it has 40 students, 50 at a push. I didn't make friends. I have one person who I can talk to in a lesson, and by 'talk', I mean giving him the answers while he slacks off.


March, 2020, present day: I've found a girl online who weirdly likes me back, which is crazy. I've talked to her for almost two months, and she's not too far from me, but she's all I really have in terms of in-real-life interaction. Or so, I thought. I wanted to see her in April, but now it seems I can't. Why? Lockdown. So, here I was, thinking I'd actually hang with someone, maybe even ask them out, waiting for the moment, all to get blown by THIS STUPID FUCKING DISEASE


I AM SO TIRED OF BEING ALONE
yeah, sure there's online people, but who else?
who else can i share a fag with? 
who else can i show off my hoodies to? 
who else can i hop on a train with? 
who else can i buy a present for?

fppphk,"Build a wall, why dontcha?","So, I'm a Canadian, living in Canada, in my home which is an hour north of the border. 15 years ago I was a Canadian living in the US. In a small quaint city about an hour South of the border. That is where I met him. The one who made me realize that I would never be happy with another. He was my person. 

But, I was a big city girl in a small town where I was an interloper. I came back home to Canada after a fiery 3 year romance with the one. 

We kept in touch, keeping the romantic feelings for each other, and supporting each other throughout our lives ups and downs. He was so close and yet so far... I didn't want to lose him. 

Sometimes we would go a few days without talking, and once after a STUPID fight neither of us can remember what was about, we did a few weeks of crushing silence and we agreed that it was the worst, promising to never be so hurtful to each other again. 

I had finally committed myself to going back, being his wife, because of all of my lofty dreams, I realized that they didn't matter if he was not a part of them. 

Then, this modern plague has come into the world. 

We didn't dare speak of the possibility that we would have to be separated, his life is there, I have obligations that keep me here, that I could not just walk away from...

This was not going to be easy.

Well, the new rules came out and they said DECIDE RIGHT NOW. What side are you going to choose? The clock is ticking. 

The world's longest non militarized border has now been closed since the beginning of its making. There is no end in sight,  and we will not be together, if ....God Please No! .... i can't say the words.... We are alone. Separated by an imaginary but very real line in the sand.

fppxub,Invisible Essay,"Just a random essay I wrote after watching Invisible Sister on Disney, great film btw, if you're here then you should deffo watch it lol. Here goes:

🌬❄️

People never talk about what they can’t see. Probably because it’s hidden in plain sight. Invisibility is all around us, even in the most familiar places. Both the seen and unseen, existing side by side. Arguably, we can't change it, no matter how much someone may want to.

❄️

I’m not the person everyone thinks I am. I’m the person with a mask. I’m the person who doesn’t even know what’s behind the mask. I’m the person too afraid to find out.

So; I’m the person nobody notices. I’m the person no one pays attention to. I'm the person who prefers to be alone. I'm the person who makes myself invisible. I'm the person who lives in the dark.

I’m the sarcastic one. I’m the person who may be too blunt. I’m the criminal but never the victim. I'm the person who only works in the blackest of days, the darkest of nights.

They say I’m the negative one, but I’m just the realistic once.

It's said that when you’re part of something bigger than yourself, it makes you better. But what if you’re not? I’m the invisible one, who’d prefer to face it alone. It’s easier to avoid and create a void, then it is to try and be seen. So I just embrace it, and welcome the abyss I’ve become accustomed to.

There’s a light. A light that only a few have. A light so bright that it attracts the attention of others like moths to a flame. It’s a light that spreads to others around them, emitting a powerful sonar like wave. This light finds the darkest corners of a person, and illuminates those areas.

But my light bulb is broken. I cannot do that. I cannot be optimistic about every little thing. I cannot help others feel what they’d like to feel. I help people feel what they MUST feel. I help people open their eyes to the painful truth of situations. I emit darkness.

❄️

Invisibility is everywhere. But the line between visible and invisible isn’t that wide. Transformation from one side to another is indeed possible. Invisible things can  enter the light, just as easily as visible things can step into the shadows.

What people see, what they really see, either the invisible or the visible, depends on us. Only when we are not afraid to show the world who we are, will we become truly visible. 

But until then, the shadows will be our home 🌑🎭",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fppxub/invisible_essay/,Loyalfrost,1,2020-03-27 12:37:47,1,/r/lonely/comments/fppxub/invisible_essay/,NaN
fppzxn,Hi! Lonely here,"I’m sorry about my lack of grammar I suck at this kind of thing and seeing in gen is hard enough 
——————————————————————
I used play on severs a lot with friends had a a realm at one point things were going amazing 
But ya know how it is friends lose interest and we went are ways 
things began to get bad 
I was bullied for 3 years no one did anything to stop it 
So I lost trust in the world then I met my friend she made everything alright 
Then we met my future torcher 
She set my other friend up with her now boyfriend and the girl I liked is already dating 
My torture always made fun the fact I wasn’t going out with anyone 
Eventually though she asked me out and I accepted I tried to put effort into the relationship but failed she had a habit of making people miserable so I didn’t break up with her and well loneliness is hell of a pain 
So I went off into the world of SCP and Minecraft till she eventually broke up with me I found out the had told a secret of mine one of those ware telling could destroy someone’s rep 
She didn’t do to me what she did to her other date but in a way she has destroyed me worse

fpq15n,Why I am alone,"I think the reason why I’m alone is because I get annoyed of people my age easily. I’ve reflected back on my social skills etc..I feel that I’m a bit mature for my age and see things differently.

I do like to hang out, have fun etc with these people, but I feel that over time some things may start to annoy me, and I start to distance. I get along with older people the best, but of course there isn’t an opportunity for me to find that in university. I’ve just accepted I won’t really find what I’m looking for til I’m older and working, and that’s fine. Just want to be able to build stable friendships with mature and chill people.

fpqd5z,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music","Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

How the hell am I always depressed with no reason, I want to ask for help but don’t know what to ask for. I feel like I’m too young to be feeling this way yet too old to act out the way some people my age do (21). No reason to be on my phone at all, I never stayed in contact with any friends. Old people at my job stay texting on their phones and to fit in I have to open up Facebook and take it off when someone passes by so I don’t accidentally strike up an unwanted conversation. I feel so alone yet act too antisocial to feel the way I am. I always think about the times “I felt happy” when in reality I never did, it’s just my mind accepting that I was less impacted by this feeling before.

fpr6u6,I still think about her,"It's weird, for years I liked her and we got along great. But when I accepted that she'd only ever see me as a friend and decided to no longer try to date her, that's when everything I did started to annoy her. The only thing that changed was I stopped directing my romantic intentions towards her, but suddenly all the things I said and did were considered annoying/being a bad friend, even though I'd always done them. The consistent negativity towards me and gaslighting became too much and I had to stop talking to her, but I still think about her. I wonder if we'd been able to figure out why suddenly everything I did was annoying to her, if we'd have been able to maintain our friendship? It really was a unique friendship, at least to me, and I'm sad I had to end it. But I just couldn't take being blamed for everything that wasn't my fault and being constantly told I was a bad person for things I'd always done, that had never bothered her before. I'm not saying I was perfect in our friendship, I certainly fucked up more my fair share, but I never gaslit her. I don't know. I think that was just the last straw for me. I couldn't take being called abusive when I was the one who the abuse was being aimed at. It's odd because I think she probably thinks it was all my fault and that I turned out to just be some arsehole. But I miss my best friend and I'm sad that I had to end our friendship. That's all this rambling is about really. I had to end the friendship because of how she was treating me but I don't feel any better for it. Towards the end our friendship made me feel like I wasn't worth anything, and that she was only talking to me because she didn't have a romantic partner to talk to. But now I just feel deeply lonely. 
Maybe that was our problem? I fixated my romantic interest on her for too long, and she used me as a surrogate for the romantic attention she needed when single, so when that stopped happening things broke down. I don't know? 
I don't even know why I rambling all this, I just didn't have anyone else to tell it to. It's not the full story, it's not even 1/100 of the full story, and I don't like airing my dirty laundry to other people, but sometimes you just need to get it out a little. 
Anyway, I know she's leaving for the army soon so I hope she does well in that and I, genuinely, hope she lives a happy life and is able to find whatever it is she's looking for.

fprt8l,Why are men more bitter about being lonely then women?,"(Disclaimer no hate in men, I really just want to know)
Is it cause y’all feel you have to make the first move? 
Or that you can’t express your feelings to no one? 
I honestly don’t know. Cause women aren’t that bitter when a man doesn’t want them, I think that’s cause we turn our hatred more inward. And yes girls can get sex and attention from guys easier but is it always the attention that we want ? No. I could have 500 men behind me right now ready to date me and still feel lonely. Even my friends who have boyfriends say they feel uncared and lonely even in a relationship. I’m saying all this cause someone on here told me women can’t be lonely which made no sense btw. Anyone can feel lonely, don’t tell someone they can’t feel a certain way. And I know a lot of guys on here would die for some affection or a girlfriend but there’s also a massive majority of men who use women for sex and play them, cheat on them. And yes we could probably find someone new faster but when us women invest emotional in someone its extremely hard for us to detach ourselves from someone, I could talk to a guy all day long but if there’s no emotional connection I end up feeling lonely. And I know plenty of girls at my college who get ignored by guys or feel uncared about, I mean I myself have invested in a guy before who didn’t like me back and I spent like freakin 2 years trying to get over him. But I didn’t act bitter towards all men or get angry about it, really I just felt shit about myself. Don’t mean to be harsh here I really do sympathize with lonely guys. And of course not all dudes who are lonely act angry or bitter but a lot do. 
So I’m just curious as to how y’all feel, society has beaten in to young men’s brains that if they can’t get a girl their not a man, so I guess that’s why y’all are so scared to approach a girl because of rejection. But guys who can get girls throw that weight around and treat love like it’s nothing . So that makes me wonder if all guys just want a girl or sex as a ego booster but not actually find someone to have a true connection with. Let me know how y’all feel? Always be gently, I just want civilized reasonable responses. And if you don’t wanna comment on here you can always pm me and we can talk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fprt8l/why_are_men_more_bitter_about_being_lonely_then/,save-me-from-myself-,1,2020-03-27 15:04:30,3,/r/lonely/comments/fprt8l/why_are_men_more_bitter_about_being_lonely_then/,NaN

fps4t0,"I overworked myself, got sick because of so much stress and now I'm feeling worthless","I don't know exactly what I wanted by posting here. I just don't know who I should tell.

I've been having a hard time since a year ago. Around July, the same problem as today. Actually, I am currently in my 3rd year of college that is very far from my hometown. I love everything I do, organization, volunteer, even academic works are interesting. But, a year ago, I was at my worst, worse than today. I actually lied to my friend about my whereabout in case they want to find me. I cut contact with all of them, only keeping contact with my family who know nothing about my condition. I ran away from my responsibility. I know I was a really shit person. I locked my self in a room, barely eating, barely communicating, barely washing, never cleaning the place. I was really stressed, lonely and miserable. And sometimes, I thought about dying /Yes, I am still suicidal and very lonely/ That was happening for two months. 

I managed to snap out of it because of a volunteering work I always wanted to do since before I entered college. Even it was really hard for me at first. I met my therapist without telling anyone, and then everything got better. It sounds like everything was solved, but trust me, it only looks like it did. On the beginning of September I have to start the new semester and push myself no matter what I feel. With some consideration, I refused to be involved in any organization and my club, only focusing on academics. I said to all my friend that I am taking rest from this year until graduation and will not participate heavily in any academic and non academics works. But even by doing that I still feel very stressed. 

The problem came this year. There is this thing called ""Studio"" in my major. It is a very big deal and I already asked not to be involved too much in it. But there's this thing that made me had to take the responsibility of being the person in charge of a core team. I have this image that kind of made my friends trust me for that. While inside I was still battling, I managed to make my self join another war. Although on the outside, I looked fine. I got sick several times because of stress and overworking, even had to be taken to an emergency room one day because I can't walk at all. It's been only three months but I already got awfully sick for more than five times. It doesn't count the minor sickness I have to bear every day. My parents keep telling me to rest and rest but like they don't really know how much I'll burden someone else and myself in the future by taking some more days off.

Ten days ago I got awfully sick. I had to take a rest and I did. You know how sick people tend to work less. I was really disappointed of my team presentation and felt really worthless. I actually asked my team to work on it and helped as much as I could by giving detailed instruction and even did some part by myself. But, my team is awfully dependant on me, they did nothing of what I instructed. My usual self would be there to help them working on it, telling them step by step on how to do something. But, I had to get sick and I couldn't be a backup for them. I was disappointed at my team at first, but then, I started to blame my self for the inability of my team working without me.  

The worst is that, I found out some of them just don't care about the project, even asked me to work on their part when i am still sick. I thought, maybe that's why they depend on me so much. They let me work on everything by myself. They are not unable to do it but they just felt too tired to even study about it, and there's me who is already studying on it. I just had to do it myself. I remembered there was a week when everyone left me alone until late night in a room working on a presentation by myself. I thought at that time they were busy and I had to help them. I never thought badly of them until these days. 

I felt really hurt. I was sick and I wanted them to help me for this week only but they don't care about me. I felt really useless and worthless as a person. I remembered how my therapist asked me carefully if maybe my friends are using me. I thought there's no way they are like that. But, thinking of it carefully made me realize how much they were using me as tool to work on the project. I was already stressed out from all this workload and now I realized my friends don't care about me. I feel really bad about myself, I feel unwanted, unworthy, incapable, and just stupid. 

Since a year ago, almost everyday I think that I should just die because I have no purpose in my life. I've always felt really lonely, that nobody understands me. They all are saying they will be there for me but they'll be gone in a flash. I'd like to think they care, but I've been hurt a lot, I can't seem to believe it anymore. I also felt like my future is not what I really want in life, actually I want nothing at all, just no future, just to end everything. I always say I hate living, I don't want it. Now, all this added, I just want to die even more than before. This is so tiring to me.   

I know I have loving parents and sister, and some friends who actually care about me. But sometimes they are not enough. Most time I think it's not worth to live this life just because of them. If only they'd not get hurt because of me, I'd kill myself a long time ago. Also, this self isolation is making me feel worse day by day. It enhances the feeling of loneliness I have. Reading texts feels really people are acting cold to me. I can't be sure if it is just my imagination or not. 

I guess, thank you for everyone who read it till the end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fps4t0/i_overworked_myself_got_sick_because_of_so_much/,hanaiku,1,2020-03-27 15:32:50,0,/r/lonely/comments/fps4t0/i_overworked_myself_got_sick_because_of_so_much/,NaN
fps59o,25M looking for friendship?,"Hiya everyone! Let me just get this out of the way. I have social anxiety, so making friends is pretty difficult as I come off as socially awkward and weird.   
I guess I could tell a little about myself..
I enjoy gaming (ps4 mainly), I enjoy watching movies, but I don't really enjoy it when I watch alone because I have no one to discuss the movie with. It's the same with watching videos on youtube. I have started getting back into ERBs (if you know you know). I enjoy listening to music. My playlist is all over the place, so I basically will listen to anything. 
I am open minded. I will talk about anything. Puns. Jokes. Conspiracies. ANYTHING! (As long as you don't get offended easily) 
Here is where I believe people will be turned away. I do make tiktoks out of boredom, and yes they are cringy but tiktok itself is cringy. 

So basically if you want an open minded, lonely, socially awkward friend.. message me. I'll talk to anyone. Any age. You could be male, female, alien, or zombie, and I will still find a way to talk to you!

fpsm8r,Been feeling better lately so I haven’t posted here in a while but now I’m back.,"I’m back because, well, I’m lonely. For a while I blamed myself but come to think of it I have nothing to blame myself for. I consider myself a genuine person that is kind to others, and probably cares too much for others as well. When people want nothing to do with me it’s easy to blame myself, which is what I have done, but realistically it’s other people that are to blame. I have no friends because I choose to not have friends. Not because I’m incapable of friendship, but because the people I usually allow to get close to me aren’t bettering my life in anyway. They are actually making my life worse. I tend to hold onto friendships, or relationships for that matter, longer than I should. Only for it to end by their choosing when I should’ve been me to end it. I knew all along it wasn’t worth my time, yet I gave it my everything. And when they finally decide to cut me off, it feels like a diss to me. Like I’m the one that caused it. Everyday I try to progressively become better at not caring about other people as much, but there is still that void that needs to be filled. Will I ever find the right one to fill that gap? Who’s to say. I will keep trying though. I do know that next time I won’t be wearing the shoes in the relationship. A precautionary for myself, so I won’t let myself be hurt by someone again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fpsm8r/been_feeling_better_lately_so_i_havent_posted/,crazy_brazy22,1,2020-03-27 16:16:31,0,/r/lonely/comments/fpsm8r/been_feeling_better_lately_so_i_havent_posted/,NaN

fptj74,Love getting mindfucked.,"I don't even know where to begin. I put up a post here yesterday. After finding out my ex had been cheating on me. I recently broke up with her but before talking to her I would just stay inside alone.

I never realised how lonely I was until we broke up and within a week roughly I tried to take my life.
I'm a 16 year old bald guy (before the trend gtf) with messed up teeth and an even worse mental state and honestly I don't even know why I'm writing this.

I thought I loved her but as time passes it's clear to me that I didn't love her. I loved what I saw her as because I think subconsciously I was willing to overlook her flaws like lying and manipulating because it had been so long since I had been with someone. I hate feeling like that, it makes me feel shallow and just like a piece of shit in general.

I had been on my own for a pretty long time before I met her and both of my other ex's were cheating liars too so I really didn't trust people much and would constantly over think everything people said.

But for whatever reason I just forgot about it because I havent been happy in so long. Because I was happy I placed a lot of trust in her, told her a lot of things and this made it much more crushing when she just left all of a sudden.

It took me a little while to get over her, but as I said as shallow as it may sound, I'm pretty sure it was the idea of her that I loved. Not even sure why I'm posting this really just feel like someone should see it.

I’m officially the last one of my friends to get a boyfriend. My friend let me know today and I instantly wanted to jump off a cliff, but instead I played the excited friend role and insisted she give me every painful detail. I imagine instantly bursting into tears would’ve put a damper on her enthusiasm.

Now every time I meet with my friends, I can hear all the stories about how loved they all are. Or maybe they’ll bring their boys and I can sit by myself, the seventh wheel.

It’s the shame that hurts the most. I feel like I’m failing because everyone else has got someone. I feel like I’m wrong because nobody wants me.
I wish someone was interested in hearing what I have to say. I wish someone would think I’m special for once. I’m so sick of being a background character in everyone else’s lives.

We invite everyone who feels lonely to sign up to our platform. Our main aim is to make people feel less lonely and help them get through this uneasy time.

We are also calling on any students of Psychology, Psychotherapy or Social Work or people with experience/knowledge in those fields to become Hearts - vetted volunteers who want to be part of the project. We will provide them with all the tools (scheduling and videoconferencing software) to do this remotely.

My frustrations have caused me to nearly killing myself twice back then, though I am more religious now and vow to never do it again, though I still think of death sometimes. The worse part is that I'm constantly being made fun off because I'm still single and a virgin by my peers. Even my parents always ask me why I'm still single and never date anyone yet, They compare me to my cousins who are my age and have beautiful foreign gfs. They always say that I focus too much on my studies , and that I don't have a social life or a gf, which makes me a loser. When I think, hear or even see things that are related to love such as  seeing couples holding hands or kissing, I tend to feel bitter, jealous, depressed and lonely, it doesn't help because I see happy couples all the time in my college. I feel like an empty husk of a soul, and sometimes I break down and cry or even feel a bit suicidal though I always manage to fight it back. Its best I try to not think about it and distract myself with other things I like such as cooking and culinary arts, travelling, studying in college, video games. Even then it is hard because I constantly get reminded of how lonely I am from the dating ads that I get, realizing everyone in my friends and family around my age already have gfs except me which causes me hard to fit in with them , and being seen as a virgin loser by my old classmates whom I told I was not dating anyone yet because I was focusing on studies though they ended up saying that they have long term relationships and are better in studies compared to me,  which makes me feel like utter shit and worthless. Even one of my friends who lost all hope for love and is extremely antisocial found someone too. I sometimes pray to god and ask why it is so hard for me to find someone even though I have tried in blood and sweat and have done everything to improve myself.  Maybe I have been cursed or something. I just want to love and be loved, to spend time with someone, I am tired of being lonely and sad all the time, being jealous as my peers show off how happy they are in relationships that they say I will never have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fq7884/i_always_feel_so_lonely_worthless_with_no_hope_of/,TheDepressedChef,1,2020-03-28 07:20:37,2,/r/lonely/comments/fq7884/i_always_feel_so_lonely_worthless_with_no_hope_of/,NaN
fq79zd,How do I get a boy to love me,"Hello everyone. About six months ago I was able too get on proper medication, I have Major Depressive disorder. I am very happy, which I am lucky for. I had been on my own 7 years before that, 4 of those years I was in cyber school and unable to get out of bed. I'm happy now and have delt with my problems but still feel a desire to love. A Boy at my school used to always say nice things to me, the moment I feel in love was when he held me as I was on the cafeteria floor having a panic attack. I never felt so loved in my life. I am kinda cheesy and wrote lover letters, and little poems, and thought about all the nice things I could do but I never showed him. Later he told me how cute this other girl was and how he wished he could have sex with her. I went in the bathroom and cried, later that day I told him and he never responded to me again. I'm a lot better now but I just want that. I want someone to smile at me and tell me I'm pretty, I hold them when they are sad and they hold me, we play hard to get and laugh and joke about memes and talk about are lives, and even the little silly childhood stories are interesting. I'm much more social now infact I would consider myself and extrovert but I still have a sensitive side. I just need to know what I'm doing wrong how can I improve. If you think you can somehow evaluate me or give me tips on how to be better that would be great.

fq7smj,Finally confessed to a friend that I've liked for over a decade now and got shot down,"I won't say I'm suprised but I think there was always a part of me holding out hoping it would work out. My last relationship about 4 years ago fell apart in part to circumstance and to myself thinking more about her then the person I was with. 

I told her it was ok that it wouldn't affect our friendship and it probably won't change anything between us. 

She said it was probably because she is pretty much the only girl I interact with. I have been getting more introverted and shut in over the year which says a lot because I was always the quiet kid.... I still had my adventurous college days partying and dating somehow and all the times she was in my life she was always number 1. But it wouldn't make a difference bringing that up. Of course my default is callous and cruel so I can't blame anyone but myself that the vast majority if these feelings never made it out of my head. Actions have always spoken louder then words for me. Sure I was a jerk sometimes but out of all the humans I interact with I treated her the best and with the most consideration. 

She isn't even my ideal girl, I don't think I was ever truly madly in love but the flame that I hold for her will probably never go out. 

It's crazy for me when I about how it's been over 10 years.. sure I would switch between love and hate in between but that was more me trying to deal with unrequited love. I can say with certainty that I've never not felt anything towards her. 

I'll keep typing forever if I don't send this now. Im hoping reflecting like this will make trying to move on easier but I've never been good at that.(moving on) I've held grudges for years.

There is no resentment and I'm ok with that, even though for some reason I feel like there should be.

fq8t98,I need to hear what lonely people have to say about this behaviour,"Hello everyone,

I have a problem that's been weighing on my mind. I am someone who has a good relationship with my family and I am surrounded by many loving friends and colleagues. My bf is the complete opposite, no friends, no family and one or two colleagues he speaks to occasionally. I have a really good relationship with my socially awkward BF, he's very open about his feelings, namely his feelings of loneliness before meeting me. He is very kind and I can feel that he loves me very much. He is very attentive to me and I didn't feel unloved in the slightest. I also love and care for him very much, and I hope to show the same attentiveness. 

One day I came across strange (flirty) comments to a Thai woman on Fb. This was the beginning of the story. Initially, when I confronted him, I also (respectfully) questioned this woman about their relationship. She said to me that there is nothing between them however at some point he said he will come to see her, and when he never did, she realised she was wasting her time. His response was that these women want money, she is meaningless and it's just a game/joke. At the time I didn't understand what he was talking about. He apologised after I let him know I was upset and he promised never to comment like this, even as a joke. 

However, I was troubled by the following of many of these Thai women. It was as if he had no real friends. I checked this woman's account and it was strange. Full of 50+ year olds (many caucasian) who send similar comments. 

I dumped him eventually because I was immensely stressed by the whole situation and his attachment to social media (especially these Thai women).

Later I spoke to my friend and she told me exactly what these women are. They are women who provide comfort or chats or a relationship to lonely men and then ask for money. 

4 days after breaking up with him, I noticed on social media he has a new Filipino 'gf'. He promises to meet with her very soon, when he is in Europe and he has no plans to meet her. He posts flirty comments and claims her. It is a similar pattern to the Thai woman. It's like a self-esteem boost, or maybe a cure to his loneliness.

Soon after I spoke to him about this (in my opinion) 'toxic' coping mechanism. I asked him what kind of future he expects with this kind of behaviour? Which woman would accept this? and I asked him if he could proudly tell his only guy friend about this strange and dysfunctional behaviour. I asked him if he wants to save up his money and when he reaches 50+ he will seek out this fake relationship?

He broke down. And he showed me his true face. He was crying and he said he confirmed that his actions don't make sense. He said he is so alone that he is broken and tired of life and he wants to die. He only ruins my happiness, just as he has always brought negativity to anyone around him and now there is no-one. 

I do admit that I told him that he has made me upset and he didn't realise that he was hurting me. This was said in my fits of pain, betrayal and rage.

So I wonder if anyone here can relate to him and if/how you were able to overcome your desire for attention/ego-boost/self-esteem boost/filling the void of loneliness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fq8t98/i_need_to_hear_what_lonely_people_have_to_say/,anongoshi,1,2020-03-28 08:45:23,12,/r/lonely/comments/fq8t98/i_need_to_hear_what_lonely_people_have_to_say/,NaN
fq8xns,Trying to be with people makes me miserable and I hate myself for it.,"Hi, this is my first post here so I'll get right to the point. 
After 2 years being completely lonely I tried to reach out and make friendships. After being rejected and failing many times, I managed to keep talking to three people and we ended up becoming friends. 
After I did all this I thought my depression and suicidal tendencies would be easier to deal with because I had a more normalised aspect of my life. Thing is, they make me absolutely miserable, and the one friendship I had before this made me miserable as well. 
I'm starting to fear that I will just never be in a place where I can be happy. They don't do anything particularly wrong, but we are very different people and to my fault, they make me feel insecure and scared about my personal progress for some reason.
I don't know if this is a consequence of me becoming so much of an outsider that not I can't escape it. I'm scared that I'm just too broken and that every chance I had at feeling good with people is now gone. 
Every friendship that almost and did happened for a while ended up with me at rock bottom, hating myself and wanting to be alone. Once I managed to be alone I would still feel lonely. 

I honestly don't know what to do or if I can ever be happy, I can't stop feeling bad and I don't know if I am even verbalizing things correctly. It's unbearable at this point and I can't stop thinking about suicide. 
I can't be with people, I can't be alone and I don't feel like i can be happy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fq8xns/trying_to_be_with_people_makes_me_miserable_and_i/,I_AN_3,1,2020-03-28 08:52:17,3,/r/lonely/comments/fq8xns/trying_to_be_with_people_makes_me_miserable_and_i/,NaN

fq9r6q,I feel lonely :/,"Hey. I wanted to share something. I feel like reddit is my safe place, place where I can let out everything I've been holding in.

I am 21M, and I am university student. So I have everyday interaction with people (not rn due to coronavirus but I mean like in global). Everything is like okay when I am at the uni, I hangout with people on classes and on breaks and stuff like that, you know. But I dont have anyone to hang out with besides uni. Like I dont have anyone to go out on Friday""s night, and weekend. Like everything is cool but no one ever asks me out. It makes me sad. Especially in those spring days (omg I loveee spring) when all coffee shops have their chairs outside and everything is perfect, sun is shinin' on me (DJ Khaled lol), beautiful girls(Sean Kingnston) and everything is just damn perfect. Everything except I dont have anyone to enjoy with. Sometimes I go to the downtown and just walk by myself, looking all the people enjoying and I really wish I have someone to enjoy as well. It is even worse on summer, when we have summer vacation. Whole summer alone. I ride bike, and watch other people have fun, whising I have fun too. Coffee shops are full, people are living their best, It makes me happy when I see people happy, but also when I came home, I realize again, I wish I can too. Also on summer, sometimes I lie to my parents that I am going out with my friends, just not to seem lonely. Then I go out and just walk by myself. I would really love to have someone I can talk to and tell all things on my mind, to let everything out of me. I am happy and sad in the same time. I can't put everything on this post, maybe it will be more in upcoming days.

fqaocq,"I'm here, I'm alone and I always will be.","As the title says, I am alone. I'm 36, and the only woman who ever payed attention to me left me in August of 2018. There was always a part of me that thought that I would end up this way and feared it. I always tried my best to always show love and compassion with everything that I've ever done. I never think of only myself, I honestly don't know how to. 

I've had brief conversations with people online, but it never fails that when I start developing feelings for that person, they always say that they don't feel the same way and I wind up with a broken heart, it's happened twice so far. People that I think that I can see a future with shatter me all over again. Of course I don't want them to know how deeply they've hurt me so I pretend everything is fine, even go as far to wish them luck in their ventures as I lay broken. I would never want to want them to feel hurt because they've broken my heart, but I'm so tired of giving my all to someone only to be met with rejection. Why can't anyone ever feel toward me what I feel toward them? 

I just moved into a new apartment and literally days afterward the quarantine happened. I've been shut off from pretty much all social contact. It's been so hard, I had a panic attack the other day because of all of this, the second one of my life. 

How many times can I do this? How many times can I give up pieces of myself until I'm empty? I love everyone, is it so hard for just person to love me back? Maybe I'm asking the impossible, maybe I should just resign myself to a life of longing and loneliness. Nihilism and I have never got along too well, but it could be time to become reacquainted. I don't want to suffer anymore and I don't know how to assuage that. 

Another thing, I'm tired of people telling me that I'm good looking or that I have a great personality. If either of those things were true life wouldn't be the way that it currently is.

He didn't seem receptive so I quoted some lyrics that were relevant to me and this one was one of them: ""that's not just friendship that's romance too"".

It didn't have the expected outcome, he said that it was beautiful but he didn't really paid attention to my quotes.

fqawnm,"I feel empty and lonely, and I'm tired all the time","Hi everyone. I'm not sure what's wrong with me to point out something specific in nature, but I do know that I'm not happy or content with things.
Warning, this might be a long post.

I'm 20, doing engineering currently. I do enjoy the course; it's difficult, but it's something that I enjoy to an extent and I'm hoping to go further into audio engineering (music is the most important thing in existence to me)

I'm lonely and I'm unhappy with how i am. Gained weight and looking worse by the day. I'm quite confident and popular at my university and I do well in studies. I have friends who care for me and love me for who i am. I have supportive parents, and while we're not rich or well off by any means, we're okay and we're doing fine. 
Yet, I'm still unhappy. 

I had a girlfriend of 3 years, deeply in love as she was the first and only person I've loved in my life. She helped me through some of the toughest points of my life and she made me the person i am today. We've split due to being forced to live in places that are thousands of miles apart, with no sight of the future, or if we could ever meet again. 

The breakup hurt, badly. I was lonely, feeling empty, broken and grieving. Time heals everything, and it did the same. Tomorrow will mark 2 years from the last time I saw her, and I can feel my heart ache as i write this down. 

I feel empty and lonely every single day. I've moved on now, to an extent atleast and I've grown out of that. Yet I still have so much love to give and so much affection to pour yet I have no one to share it to. I fall in love with different people everyday, with strangers, with random people on the train. I make up scenarios in my head and break my own heart again. 

Only a shell of what I used to be as a person, i feel I've lost my passion for things except for playing music. She taught me how to play the ukulele, and I moved onto play the guitar, bass, piano and sitar and I'm okay at all of them tbh, just not excellent, but it doesn't matter either. i enjoy it. I've lost my passion for other things too. I don't have the energy to watch movies, or draw or read or text anymore. 

A few months ago, I met another girl. Totally different from my ex, but still a good person. We hit it up well, started dating quickly and broke up just as quick, mainly to our fault. We went in too quick and i went in with the thought of ""yeah i finally have a girlfriend"" and not ""yeah, i have her as my girlfriend"". It's bad and it'll only ruin things, but I did it anyway. 

Got hurt, started getting worse than before and went down a very bad path of self-harm in non violent and physical ways. I don't wanna die, but I don't have much to live for either. What's a life if i can't give all the love in me to someone?

I'm tired of being lonely and feeling empty. I'm tired of being the popular person, but having no one to talk to at the end of the day other than my housemates. I'm tired of falling in love with strangers at the bus stop because i don't receive the love i give. I'm tired of staying up till 4am, listening to the same 20 songs on repeat, expecting some magical lover to pop up. I loved her more than i ever loved myself, and when she left, i lost the part of me i loved the most, and now, i only feel like a cracked shell. I'm tired of being me. I'm tired of all of it.

Goodnight reddit, you've been kind. This might be one of my last posts. Thank you for everything. COVID-19 has made this a good excuse. I'm still in the process of thinking, but yeah. 

The quarantine didn't change much either. I feel like I'm at a mental impasse, where nothing affects me anymore other than my own mind. Quarantine? okay. Last minute stress? okay. hungry? nothing to eat?  okay. I just don't feel things anymore, and it hurts not feeling anything except an unfillable, empty void.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fqawnm/i_feel_empty_and_lonely_and_im_tired_all_the_time/,yesiamadorito,1,2020-03-28 10:48:51,0,/r/lonely/comments/fqawnm/i_feel_empty_and_lonely_and_im_tired_all_the_time/,NaN
fqaz3s,I don’t want to be alone anymore.,"I’ve done all the things people say your supposed to do to fill the void that loneliness brings. I worked out, made healthier food choices, I prayed, for on antidepressants and don’t get me wrong those things helped.... however I’m still lonely. I long for a life partner. Someone to come home too. Someone who can’t wait to text me in the morning, or really ever. 

Why is that so wrong? Why is it taboo to just admit that you want love? To want someone to be with forever, someone who loves and likes you as much as you love and like them. Sometimes I feel like life is this game and I just get so tired of playing it sometimes. Not that I’d ever harm myself because I wouldn’t! But I get so tired of being “strong” and “pushing through “ and “fighting” day in and day out and I’m great full for all the things I have in my life but sometimes I just wish I didn’t have to feel any of it. Or go through these things. Honestly we’re all gonna die at some point anyway so what is the point ? I feel like I’m destined to be alone. I wonder if there even exists a person who is for me.

fqbxzd,I’m slowly fading away... I try to push my friends away but it doesn’t work,"I’m not alone but I feel lonely, which leaves me with a sense of selfishness and guilt. 
When I’m quiet my friends ask me what’s wrong and when I get distant they look for me once they notice I’m absent. I get so angry and upset on the inside when they do this. I don’t deserve them.

Yes, I like to have friends and hang out with them but sometimes I miss those days when I was invisible, didn’t have any friends and I didn’t struggle with these feelings.
I feel so disgusted at myself, why do I have friends? Why do people like me? Can’t they see how horrible I am? I love them so much and I always try to show it. I’m considered the bubbly happy go lucky friend that’s always trying to make other people smile so whenever I’m feeling like crap and I can’t hide it everyone gets concerned. I can’t understand why I am this way.
My best friend threw me a surprise birthday party and all my friends attended, do you know how hard it is to do that? I cried that day because I felt so incredibly loved.
I hate myself so much. So many people would wish to have friends like mine. I’m so ungrateful. I feel their love but I don’t know how to accept and process it, I don’t think I deserve to be love.

I think of myself as a disposable person... I have this thought that one of these days my friends are gonna leave me one by one after they get tired of putting up with my annoying ass.

fqdxxy,I don't feel wanted,"Hi all,

I just joined this group because I don't know where else to vent my feelings. I'm going to make this post as short as I can. 

I have an issue coping with my insecurities. I feel like my brain is spinning around in my head. Something that really bothers me is that I don't recieve the reciprocated attention that I want from my friends. I also feel like the way I feel is irrational amd selfish. But it hurts that some people I really care about and hold close to me don't seem to feel the same way. There is one person in particular who I love and I miss her and I want to hang out but she never contacts me. It's always one sided. And I have to beg to hang out. She claims to care about me but the fact that if I never messaged her we'd probably never talk again sucks. I have one best friend that actually cares and talks to me everyday and I am thankful. But I can't help that I also miss and care for others. I don't know what to do or how to feel better about it. I have a handful of friendships like this. It makes me feel lonely and worthless. It also hurts that I am never invited to outings. I feel ostracized. I think I am a great friend and person and I can't figure out why I can't find good friends or make good bonds. I also feel like for as old as I am I shouldn't be so emotionally immature about this. I am just confused and upset and I can't help but think I'm an awful person.

fqezcy,Just needed to rant...,"I usually enjoy being alone but now that I am forced to stay home due to corona I feel very lonely. All I have been doing for the past week is watching movies and tv shows. I really wish I had some friends to talk to but the problem is that I recently moved to a new state and I was just starting to make some friends but now that the school is closed I can’t see them anymore. I could talk to my friends back home but I feel like I would be bothering them. The other reason I’m feeling lonely is because I want a boyfriend, I had a my first major crush at my old high school, like I had actually never liked someone and wanted to talk to them and date them ever before. And for some reason I just really liked this guy. I had always teased my friends about their crushes because I never had one or could understand why they would like anyone in that school. Anyway, I liked this dude for almost 2 years now and barely talked to him because I am a very shy person. Then when I was moving I was like, this is your chance to get over him. I didn’t want to to like him anymore, the highlight of my day was seeing him in my math class, and I didn’t want my joy to be dependent on someone else. But now that he’s not in my classes and I will never see him again I feel like I missed out and that I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I have tried to find someone else to like so I can get my mind off of this guy but I can’t. Anyway I just needed to rant and tell someone about this guy because I never told anyone that I had a crush on him and it’s something I’ve been building up for a while.

fqgstr,Tonight is my first night alone in 6 months. Really feeling it.,"I've been one of the lucky ones through this pandemic. I live with my girlfriend and another couple.

Yesterday started with a huge fight with my girlfriend. We've been having many. This time, it was just too much for both of us. Last night, I dropped her off at her sister's. Neither of us knows for how long that's going to last.

I attempted a dopamine fast today. If you're unfamiliar with the idea, it's where you intentionally drive yourself to a state of complete boredom for the purpose of starving your dopamine receptors. The point of this is to soft-reboot the brain with increased motivation and focus.

After 18 hours of no food, caffeine, exercise, reading/watching, social, interacting with friends, I finally caved into just about all of it. Going to try again now.

If any of you relate to any of this, or if you don't mind throwing good vibes my way, I'd really appreciate any interaction at all to return to when I'm done with this second fast attempt.

fqj3f4,I am willing to put effort into talking to you,"If you need a friend right now I am willing to expend energy to be there for you.  
I know that a lot of people don’t respond much on here, and I may not always be able to reply straight away, but I’ll do my best to be a friend to you if you need it.  
  
I’m not doing the best myself, there’s a lot of crazy stuff going on at the moment, and I’m dealing with a lot of my own mental health issues. But we’ll all get through it together, right?  
  
I just hope to be someone to talk to who doesn’t make you feel judged. I am equally capable of immature conversation to counter the dark feels as I am sitting in this spot with others who are stuck here until the wave rides itself out.  
  
Labelling people doesn’t really help in my opinion, so regardless of your diagnosis I won’t make an identity out of that for you in my mind. And if nothing is wrong and you just wanna talk to someone else who’s capable of more than one word replies, it’ll probably help me too!  
  
I’ll put a similar amount of energy back into you :) it’s reciprocal. If you *want* to have shallow conversation, be shallow.

fqlth1,How you can feel less isolated during the Quarantine,"Now that the Corona Virus is spreading all over the world and people work from home or are sent home from work or school, it’s important that you don’t isolate yourself.

That will only bring you more down and you will feel lonely.

Remember it is “**Physical Distancing**” NOT “**Social Distancing”**

Everyone has a need of human connections. So now it’s more important than ever that you talk with people instead of isolating yourself.

That will only lead to:

❌Loneliness

❌Boredom

❌Depression

Here are some tips and ideas how to socialize online:

✅**Call your family regularly**

It’s important to keep in touch with you family. Make sure they are all right and you can share some ideas what to spend your time on.

✅**Call an old friend you haven’t spoken with in a while**

You never know what this can lead to, catch up with an old classmate, coworker etc. People are bored and they will appreciate it If you react out to them.

✅**Get to know new people in your community**

Why not get to know new people from your area? Today there is a lot of online gathering places such as locale Facebook groups, Meetups etc.

Network with people to build up a connection, this will help you once the Corona Virus is gone.

✅**Jump on Skype Calls with strangers**

Try new things out, jump on a call with new people and learn from each other. This is also a great opportunity for you to get out of your shell.

✅**Get into online discussions**

There is a lot of people online these days because people seek human connections and that is a great time for you to get into a discussion and learn something new about a new topic.

This can also make you want to try new things out when the Corona Virus is gone.

For example, picking up a new hobby.

✅**In general, improve your online presence**

Overall learn new things, improve how you connect with people and how you engage with people on forums and Facebook groups.

Be curious and seek new opportunities.

**I hope you could use these ideas. How are you spending your time during the Corona Quarantine?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fqlth1/how_you_can_feel_less_isolated_during_the/,Jacob1988Denmark,1,2020-03-29 00:05:12,3,/r/lonely/comments/fqlth1/how_you_can_feel_less_isolated_during_the/,NaN

fqqnb3,Our Book...,"



I don’t even know why I’m typing this. I know in my heart that I need to say some things but I just can’t find the right words to say them. I’ve typed, wrote, and verbally said so many words to you that by now I could of probably written a book. I don’t know why I keep trying to write in our book. Our book is kind of dusty but every so often one of us takes a look at it and try to get rid of the dust but unfortunately with our human eyes we can’t see the dust slowly start to build back up again. If I had a choice I would pick up the book everyday and dust it off just to try and keep it looking alive. I would find a way to keep adding more and more blank pages to the book so there is always more room to write our story. What would you do with the book N? Would you take it outside and throw it into a fire pit and watch it burn? Would you maybe hide it somewhere and every so often pull it out when you’re feeling alone? 

I never wanted our book to end. Every time you’ve opened it over the years you’ve read a few pages and then you’ve slammed it shut. Each time you’ve slammed it shut you’ve damaged a page in the book. All these pages in the book that you’ve damaged just want you to feel sorry for damaging them and try to fix what you’ve broken. Sooner or later N there isn’t going to be anything else to write and by then the whole book will be damaged. You could be nice and maybe take the book to the library to donate so someone else can check it out. You can try and let go of the book so that someone else can write in the blank pages and restore the pages back to perfect condition...or you can keep the book and try to restore all the wrinkled up pages and continue writing the story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fqqnb3/our_book/,princessmaeha199920,2,2020-03-29 04:25:06,0,/r/lonely/comments/fqqnb3/our_book/,NaN

fqsds2,it might actually be killing me inside,"I push the feelings of loneliness away to get on with my everyday life and I thought I was okay. When the day’s still bright it just feels as per normal, I have my distractions and everything’s dandy. 

But somehow when night falls and at the moment before i fall asleep, my brain just reminds me  of the creeping feeling of how I am actually lonely. Without knowing or realizing, I think it’s actually breaking something inside (?) if that makes sense??? 

It’s like I’m numb to the feeling but at the same time I’m not. I want to be close to someone but at the same time I don’t. It feels like I’ll never be able to truly connect with someone and this may be because I’ve given up hope and have no motivation or whatsoever to put in the effort to get to know someone. I feel like I’ll be disappointed in the end again anyway. 

Man, I wish I move past this phase soon. Or meet someone who’s patient enough to deal with me. Which is highly unlikely when I don’t put in the expected amount of effort lol. 

Idk... I’m not even sure what I want now after several disappointments. It’s almost as if I don’t want to feel anymore that’s why I push everything away.

fqu2ib,"My brother (29M) has never had a girlfriend, and he doesn't have any true friend","I think the title says it all.

I am writing here on the behalf of my brother, who doesn't speak English very well. He doesn't know I am talking about this here. I am writing that in order to try to help him.  
He is a wonderful person. He knows his flaws and is capable to question himself. He is constantly trying to better himself. He is, objectively speaking, smart, responsible, comprehensive, curious and sensitive. Plus, he is very successful in his career. But he is deeply unhappy.   
Since childhood, he has never really been able to connect with people, he has had ""friends"" before, when he was in high school, that are no longer in the picture (and he doesn't regret them, for many reasons), but now, as an almost 30 years old adult, he is faced with the evidence that beside our family, he has no one. And he suffers greatly from it. He has tried a lot of things, he has been going to dance, sport or other classes almost every evening for a few years, he has tried several apps (including Tinder) but never succeeded in meeting anyone. He struggles to form actual bonds with people, he never really knows what to say, has a hard time letting go of his fears, which make him a bit awkward in his way of socializing. People don't really look twice on him, never contact him again, he has to do it all the time. He says he can get people to like him, but never to be interested in him as a friend or a potential romantic partner. He suffers because he is actually trying to better himself but feels like he is failing, and he doesn't know what else to do. It doesn't help that he suffers from a sensory disability that doesn't help in having a normal social life.   
He longs for relationships, for people with whom he can share things, with whom he can ravel, ... he wants a normal social life. He is currently going to therapy and has been for a year or so, but it is (obviously) very long. He feels like he lost his youth (not that he doesn't consider himself being young, but, he says that the 20s are the time where we are supposed to do so many things) doing nothing, going nowhere, having done nothing with anyone.

As his sibling, I am deeply sorry about his situation. I am not the most social person either but I have friends and a significant other. He tells me how much he envies me... I have, however, my own insecurities to deal with, so I don't really know how to help him. I love my brother to death, and his unhappiness is a terrible thing to witness.

I would love to hear if anyone else has ever been through this and how he can get better, and how I can help him ?

fqut40,Alone at last,"My mom had anger issues when I was growing up. It culminated when I was 19 and she kicked me out. It really messed with my sense of self worth and I became a sex worker to pay my rent. The men always said the nicest things to me. They showered me with compliments and validation. I remember one man gave me white roses from his garden and it’s still my favourite gift I’ve ever received. 

It’s better between my mom and I now, but I came to the conclusion that although she loves me, she doesn’t like me as a person. It’s weird to see how TV moms dote on their children and love them unconditionally. It made me feel like because my mom doesn’t like me, there’s something fundamentally wrong with me and that deep down, I’m unlovable. 

Surprise, surprise, I have issues getting close to people. I feel like if I get too close and they see the real me, they won’t like me. To prevent this from happening, I usually have a cycle of three years with friends, then I just disappear from their lives. I’m just getting off a cycle now with a group of friends. This whole social distancing situation has actually made it easier to disappear from their lives. 

But it wasn’t enough. I just ended a year-long relationship with someone. He was devastated and tried to call me out on this and tell me that he would always love me. But I wouldn’t back down.

It is my fault, that I'm like this, I could simply go out and make friends or learning a cool hobby. So I wasting my life with no purpose or meaning in it. I have no dreams, wishes, ideas or crushes like normal humans, I just feeling empty. I always hug a pillow until I fall asleep, imagining I would hug another person, but it is clear to me that I'll never be in a relationship. I don't deserve to waste precious time and energy of another person with my stupid existence. No, I get what I'm deserving, so everything is like it should be. Sometimes I even wish that I wouldn't wake up at the next day.

I live with my family that I don’t necessarily get along with. Not that we fight or have problems, we just don’t understand each other. Also, I have no friends. Quarantine time just made this a LOT more obvious. 

I used to talk to my boyfriend most of the time when I wasn’t outside studying or reading. Now, he spends the whole day sleeping and night playing video games with his friends. Which I understand!

But, having talked to no one in the past 14++ days and having no one ask about me somehow triggered the dark thoughts in my brain again and now I don’t have the energy or the mood to do anything, including reading. 

What I usually like doing in these situations is to talk to someone that would distract me from my thoughts. I kept sending messages/memes/videos to my boyfriend throughout the day, but of course he rarely answered them either because he’s sleeping, eating or busy with his game. This led me to being kind of resentful and act in a very crappy childish way aka being passive aggressive in my answers. He called me out on it and just lashed out on me by saying that I shouldn’t be one more thing to stress about in these times and now I just feel much more worse. 

He apologized and said that he didn’t mean what he said. But I know that everything he said was right. Of course, I don’t blame him for it. These things happen, and I deserved it. I know I need to change and I know I need to sort myself out. It’s just not easy when you have anxiety and depression ruining your life. 

If anyone wants to talk, don’t hesitate to message me. I don’t just like to talk and I love listening and helping out regardless of my being a mess. If you’re looking for a study buddy, same! God knows I should be studying way more!

fqx36a,Internal screaming!,"I'm so mad! Why can't I make friends? I have no one safe to vent to! 

I live with my parents, my partner is a state over getting things together for us. We are planning on moving the middle to end of April. I love my family, but I have anxiety and depression for a reason. My dad just did something to my 11 month old daughter that scared her. She started crying. He didn't do it to be mean, he put her down in the play pen so I could shower. When he put her down, she cried, he bent over really fast, putting his face in front oh hers and said REALLY?! He didn't yell, but the frustration/sarcasm was there a little and it was a fast movement. Either way it wasnt necessary to do that to her, negative reinforcement. She flinched, and cried more. You could tell he scared her. I told him he scared her, that his behavior wasnt necessary, she doesn't understand why he did that, shes a baby that cant talk yet to express her feelings of hating the play pen so she cries. I went to go shower, but my stomach was in a knot, I was shaking, and my heart was pounding. I went back and got her right away. My parents are not bad or mean people, but strict and harsh and caused all my childhood issues that I still have today. I don't want my kid having the same issues. Guess I'll just have to take really fast showers when she naps.

fqxhkg,This hurts.,"So one of my few friends has went to rehab. And I've been sending her texts everyday while she was in detox and couldn't have her phone. 

Today she called and asked if I had feelings for her.
I do and didn't lie.
Well I got told the feelings romantically were not mutal. But she was concerned I wouldn't stay her friend.

Rejection ( once again) hurts like a motherfucker. But my friends are important to me the few I have anyway  and even tho this sucks and I'm hurting ( I don't take rejection well it crushes me) I know not only does she need my support right now. She'll need it when she comes home. So of course we're gonna stay friends and I'll continue to support her in her actions and in any other way she needs.

I'm gonna put this out here too tho. This sucks I had hoped maybe there was something there and I am wondering why im good enough to be there for her. But idk I'm not good enough to take the next step with. I love this girl dearly, so even though I'm hurt and prob will be for awhile.
I'm still gonna be that guy she can always count on.

I guess this is what I'm sent here to be, good enough to be trusted, counted on, depended on and to idk be a support system.

But to actually be involved with someone

I simply can't expose my emotions to anybody, its frustrating and sometimes I just wanna scream. I have no idea why I am like this, I can't stand feeling vulnerable so that makes me keep all my emotions to myself, I can't talk about my emotional problems to anyone, even to my closest friends or to my parents. 

Sometimes I just tell everybody that I'm ok and its all chill, but deep inside I'm sad. This is really terrible and it makes my life miserable sometimes. I hate feeling that I'm in a vulnerable position and it stops me from doing things I would love to do, I feel like an alien that does not belong to this world. Whenever I have a problem I have to face it only by myself, its so hard and painful. 

This feeling of allienation also makes me be socially awkward because I feel different and misunderstood. I wish I could just tell people how I feel, but I just can't even though I'm sure that if I spoke to my friends or family they would understand.

 Also because of this I never had any romantic affection in my entire life since I would never be able to tell a girl I like her which also makes me really sad. Its not fair because I'm a great person, I love all of my friends and family and I would die for them, I'm always avaliable to help other them.

fqy7qu,I’m so tired,"I’m so tired of being lonely.

I’m so emotionally unavailable and unable to make or keep friends and now I have no one.
It’s been like his for awhile but has steadily gotten worse and worse until now, the worst it’s ever been.

No one has spoken to me besides coworkers in so long. No one messages me. No one interacts with any posts of mine on social media. No one cares. No one at all. I switch between apps constantly hoping that someone, anyone, will care...but no one ever does. I don’t know why I still hope.

I used to message people, and then I realized they never messaged me first. So I stopped messaging them to see if they’d message me, and they never did. I probably was annoying them and they were probably glad I stopped talking to them. But I miss them. It’s been years since I spoke to some of them and I still can’t get over them.

I used to be used as someone to talk at and then abandon. Now I don’t even get that. It’s like I don’t even exist. I would take someone using me for venting than this constant loneliness. I feel like I’m losing my mind.

It dawned on me the other night that no one actually likes me and I took it really hard and have been struggling more than normal since then.

I feel like I am the worst person to ever exist. I feel like I deserve to die, because I can’t even make and keep one friend. I feel like I shouldn’t have ever existed, like there’s something so broken and wrong with me that no one will ever want me and that I’ll die alone. And no one will notice.

I wish I wasn’t so alone. I wish someone cared enough to let me know but I feel so selfish and guilty for even thinking that. 

I don’t know what to do or how to climb out of this hole. It just gets deeper and deeper the older I get. I want so badly to make actual human connections but it never works out. I’m so, so lonely. But I’m scared if I try to make friends again, they’ll leave me too.

Even online, I have trouble making friends i can confidently call friends. In both online and in the real world, I stay quiet and just listen to what they say. 

I really, really, want to make friends like I see how everyone else is. But it’s so hard trying to look at someone, or even thinking something that’s not “how was your day?’. 

It’s a bit of a stretch, but I want to know what it feels like to be in a relationship like how everyone tells me about it or through being a third wheel. I’ve always wanted to feel wanted.

fr07j4,Watching people being affectionate in movies/shows makes my whole body ache in desperation for that.,I have just recently split with my child's father. We had been together for 3 years. Ever since I had my son I have been dying for affection. I crave intimacy and closeness. I was not getting that from him. It really hurts your soul to be with someone and still feel so lonely and to crave touch that isn't sexual. My relationship made me feel so low. I swear i could see hatred in his eyes when he looked at my towards the end of our relationship. I don't have anybody.

fr0a0u,College and self isolation,"As I'm sure a lot of people here have been going through as well, I've been sent home to finish the semester online. I wish I could say the loneliness I feel comes from being prematurely separated from my friends or that I won't get to see a boyfriend for a few months, but that's not the case.

The truth is that I didn't manage to make a single friend my entire freshman year of college. 

The good news is that I still have three years to go, plenty of time to amend the issue. But I'm afraid I won't know how, as my uncertainty with social interaction is what holds me back. I have Autism Spectrum Disorder, which, for me, means I do not know how to/have the confidence to approach people. Everyone has giving me a thousand and one ways to start conversations and start talking to classmates, but for me, that's like handing a kid a lego set without the instructions. I just don't get how I'm supposed to talk to strangers. That's weird, right? You don't just talk to some dude sitting next to you that you've never seen before, right? I feel like I'm going crazy here. And another issue I have with that advice is that no one ever approaches me. Why would I approach a stranger if no one ever approaches me, a stranger. It just makes no sense. But I'm loosing my mind not having any friends or social interaction, I feel like a ghost that no one can see or cares about.

My parents are useless on the matter. They've never really understood Autism and don't seem to understand that when I say I can't do something, I mean it. I'm not giving up, I'm using past events and evidence to draw the conclusion that I can't make friends. I don't mean to sound so bleak but that's how I feel: I can't make friends.

So, what was my original point? If I wasn't ripped away from any friends at school, why do I care about being home so soon? Well, that's because I ran out of time to make things right. I was trying really hard to put myself out there, to say ""hello"" or ""you're hot"" or whatever it took to make an impression, and I failed. Never said hello or told someone they were hot. I kept my mouth shut and hid in my room the whole semester. I failed as a person. My only saving grace is that I'm a strong student and have a lot of good school related opportunities, but to be honest, I don't care about those things at all. The bottom line is that I'm still unhappy and alone. I'm slowly loosing my high school friends, didn't get to start a relationship like I wanted, and I completely fail to participate in society; in that regard, I am a failure. I'm mad at myself and feel utterly hopeless, trapped in a house with two parents who don't understand and a sister that couldn't care less. I really do worry that, if I don't fix this and make some friends, I'll spiral out of control and end my life. I don't want to make people worry right now, I'm ok, but the way things are going makes me very worried that's how my story will end. 

Sorry this was so long. If you read this far, thank you. I don't know what I'm expecting out of this, (if anything at all). Last time I asked reddit a question though I got some pretty nice advice, so maybe you guys could pull through for me again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fr0a0u/college_and_self_isolation/,funky_tryhard,1,2020-03-29 14:02:04,2,/r/lonely/comments/fr0a0u/college_and_self_isolation/,NaN
fr0c9b,"If I die right now or die because of this virus - I'll be a 30 year old man who never experienced love, who doesn't know how a hug fells or what it feels like to be touched.","I've never had any friends. There's nobody in my life who asks me how I am doing or misses me or wants to do anything with me. I've never had love in my life; I've never been touched lovingly by someone else. I seriously don't know how a hug feels, cause nobody was there ever. I don't know what it feels like when somebody holds your hands. Nobody ever wanted me; nobody ever found me special. I was never the best friend. I'm just someone who's there or will be there without any regard for how anyone treats me.

Sorry for being pitiful. It's just that life's been very hard for me. I know people got worse than this, but I say extra hard cause I've got many mental health issues. I've suffered for almost all of my life from depression, I've OCD, ADHD, and I'm in the spectrum. Even the easier things in life are hard for me. My loneliness makes it more complex; I've never had any support, never had anyone to fall back to.

I'm not afraid of dying, and I want it to happen. I want to die and have attempted so many times. Still, it hurts knowing that I'll die without ever experiencing any human connection. I'll die without knowing how it feels to be loved by another human. I'll die without knowing how it feels to be happy. I'll never know how it feels to be touched by someone; I'll never know how warm it feels to be hugged. I'll never wake up to anyone besides me... This just goes on and on.

I'm crying; I cry every day and every night. It hurts all the time. Sorry I know there are people out there who are suffering, who's had it worse.

fr1qmf,I see documentaries about lonely celebrities and my heart breaks for them,"I’m not really a fan girl, I have a few favorite actors, youtubers, singers but I’ve never been able to picture myself screaming and crying at a chance to see them. They’re just people you know? I mean sure I’d like to meet them and maybe get an autograph or picture but just be cool about it. I’m sure they have enough people trying to claw their way at them constantly. It also saddens me to see or hear stories about how people take advantage of their money or the things they could do for them. For instance I have a supposed half brother who is an actor, model, singer etc. in a different country. The only way it’s ever occurred to me to meet my father is through him but I’m deadly afraid they’ll reject me or be cautious of me thinking I might be after their money. I’ll be honest, I had a rough upbringing and a hard life but everything that I’ve accomplished I’ve done on my own and I’m quite proud of that. All I’ve ever wanted was a family. I see movies or father’s interacting with their daughters and it hurts that I never had that or a big brother to bully and take care of me. As far as friends go, I’ve always been pretty introverted but I try to be the best friend I can be and I give my all to the people I love which has gotten me pushed around in the past. I’m not without faults, I’ve pushed people away because I didn’t feel worthy (I was always the poor kid) so I didn’t want to be a burden and as time has passed I’ve realized that they could’ve been great friends and I just didn’t give them the chance. As an adult I’m lonelier than ever. I’m an affectionate person with no friends and a family that is somewhat stiff when it comes to affection. I can only imagine how lonely being a celebrity must be, constantly busy and surrounded by people that want something from them. Like just wanting to hug them and be their friend and say “I’m so proud of you, I’m here for you if you want a hug or just talk about mundane things, you’re special, you matter, you’re loved”.

I'm about to be a, manager becuase of how good I am at the job,  I can do everything in the store and have never missed a day,  been late or called out. I've also come In on my days off when they need me.  But I have one thing that I absoulety hate about it.  It's when I'm dealing with a customer.  Let me explain, when a couple comes in and I take thier order, it kills me becuase I see them laughing, smiling, holding hands,  etc.  I get so jealous of that. I want a girlfriend so bad like for real I want one so bad. I want a girlfriend that texts me, asks me to hang out, come sees my at work when I least expect it, calls me to hang out at 3 am, asks me to stay the night.

They make it all about them, which is fine I have no problem talking to them about what they have going on,  but when I would try to explain what was wrong I would pour my heart out explaining. The response I would get was ""I hope you get better"" kind of off topic but I felt like that need to be said. Back to the point of this rant, I have to see customers all the time that are with someone being all happy together. And it's not like I can't not serve them, it's my responsibility to help the customer. It just kills me when I have to, like I don't show it to them, I be as helpful as I can, I make sure they have a good experience with their visit.

I've had too many people treat me like shit whenever I try to speak to them, too many people call me intimidating, and so I stopped trying.

fr2u0o,Anyone else having a hard time with the whole lockdown thing?,"warning, this is mainly just a rant lol

All I do is sit at home play video games, watch shows/movies and check my phone pretty frequently and hope that someone messages me for once but of course that never happens. But I mean that's pretty much what I did before except now I don't go to my university's campus. And one other thing is that I have lots of time to just think, think about how lonely am I.

I thought social distancing would be a nice little break but everything seems so much worse. I keep forgetting to turn in school assignments but my main concern is being more lonely than ever. I've never had any close friends or a boyfriend before and what's weird is that I never wanted those things growing up. I don't know how I did it but I used to be so happy and content with just myself. I wasn't bothered by not having friends or being invited to things, I just wanted to be home all the time and work on things I liked. Not until Senior year in high school at least. That's when I started crushing and trying to hang out with people after school and stuff but it was already the end of high school so people had already formed their little circles and I wasn't able to rebuild courage after I got rejected by a crush that year. 

As for developing friendships, that didn't go well either. I have this group of friends that I used to hang out with somewhat from middle school to Senior year but I wasn't like IN IN the group, ya know? I started hanging out with them more after school and stuff while we waited for our rides. Then I was invited to a sleepover and I think I did a good job having conversations which is something I usually struggle with. One friend even suggested that I joined their group chat which was where they talked about pretty much everything, then another friend suggested that they didn't and that was the final decision I guess :l 

Now, I'm in my second semester of college and everyone I know is dating and everyone is like locked into their friend groups and it's just been a lot harder to make friends but I felt less lonely at school. 

There's one dude I meant online that has had my intention for the last few months and he's taught me a pretty important lesson: that I'm useless af. We mainly just chatted and stuff and I thought he was super duper cute, chill, silly and just fun to be around. The more I got to know him the more I liked him. I would hook up with him periodically in hopes that maybe he'd like me more. But of course, I started to realize the pattern. We chat for a while, we hook up, he ignores me. And the thing is that despite knowing that he'll do this every time, I still won't deny him because I'm so desperate for anyone to like me.

He was the last person I really talked to and I just feel empty. I cry because I want to kill myself so bad but I can't because I have a dog and I know my family won't take good care of her. 

Anyways, this was mainly just a rant because it's depression hours rn and all these random moments from high school and stuff are all coming back to me and I want Death to release me",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fr2u0o/anyone_else_having_a_hard_time_with_the_whole/,LusterPurge01,1,2020-03-29 17:45:35,6,/r/lonely/comments/fr2u0o/anyone_else_having_a_hard_time_with_the_whole/,NaN

fr36ka,Going to school with no friends made me wanna kill myself but staying home with my family is way worse (quarantine),"They hate me. And the worse part is I can’t just leave cause this is my home and we are “family”. I use that word loosely cause I don’t think blood is a reason to put up with people constantly putting you down. I don’t know why they have to be so negative. I try to get out and exercise every second day. That makes me feel better but it feels so endless I don’t even want to go back to normal life I just want to die. I’ve never had friends. People only talk to me when they want me. I have no one to call or text unless they want help with homework. I’m in my final year of high school so I can’t afford to keep moping around and not studying, but it’s not on purpose. I wake up so tired and hopeless and I hate it. But the thought of having to go outside eventually is something I hate even more. I’m so tired how can I go back to school. I hate myself.

fr3j5j,People piss me off.,"Ever since this whole quarantine thing started, I constantly see 'friends' post screenshots of their stupid skype/whatsapp phone calls with their actual friends on insta and title it ""long distance relationships"", ""well we gotta keep up somehow"", ""quarantine can't stop up"" and similar shit. 

i genuinely don't see the point of shoving down your stupid connections down my throat. like wow, you have friends. congratulations. great you can call them since you can't possibly meet each other (technically you are allowed to hangout with one more person, i'm from germany/munich and i was outside just yesterday, none of these citizen give a fuck about the restriction, it's a bit weird).

like i'm not sure why the fuck they do this shit. what's the point. why do they think any of their other 300 people following them give a fuck? same with these stupid tag challenges, i've been mentioned 3 times but i genuinely can't stand them. almost nothing changed in my life aside from being able to visit fun places and MAYBE hang out with a friend or two, seperately.

i need to understand the psychological process behind this stupid trend. are they trying to prove that they indeed have friends? do they want us to envy their stupid phone calls? i genuinely don't get it. humans are so fucking stupid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fr3j5j/people_piss_me_off/,vitamintops,1,2020-03-29 18:55:48,141,/r/lonely/comments/fr3j5j/people_piss_me_off/,NaN
fr3jnu,Anyone else feel like life is passing them by?,"This isn't just a quarantine post, but the quarantine stuff feels like it's bringing this stuff to the forefront. This is mostly just a rant.

I'm 22 years old and I'm essentially in my sophomore year of college after swapping majors twice (long story) and it feels like I'm missing a lot in life right now. All my friends from high school are graduating (well, just finishing their undergrad degrees considering that everywhere is canceling their graduations what with the COVID-19 stuff) and here I am just spinning my wheels. I had to drop one of my classes this semester because I have enough trouble focusing on in-person classes, and online classes make that a thousand times worse, and it's just making me feel like I've fallen even farther behind my peers.

I haven't dated anyone in over a year, and I recently found out that my last boyfriend just got engaged. Like, yeah, I'm happy for him and everything, but also he's moving on and I'm just not. Like I don't dwell on our relationship, but again I haven't really dated anyone since then. That's one of the drawbacks of staying with your parents, I guess. Is the money I'm saving worth it? Totally, but it still feels bad to not be able to really date anyone while living here. Also the whole pandemic thing puts a damper on that too. Can't forget about that.

Normally I'd throw myself into some sort of project to distract myself from this stuff, like I'd audition for some community theater shows, but with all that shut down right now I don't really have a good outlet for this. So I'm posting on Reddit at 6 AM, without having slept a wink last night. I don't know what I'm going to accomplish with this except to vent a little bit of my frustration. 

Sorry if my thoughts are a bit jumbled here, but I'm tired and I'm going to bed right now. I'll check for responses when I wake up tomorrow (today I guess???), but feel free to PM if you want to chat about anything at all. Doesn't even need to be about my venting, in fact I'd prefer if it wasn't. It'd just be nice to chat with someone to get my mind off of things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fr3jnu/anyone_else_feel_like_life_is_passing_them_by/,LuckyOMann,1,2020-03-29 18:57:13,1,/r/lonely/comments/fr3jnu/anyone_else_feel_like_life_is_passing_them_by/,NaN
fr3od2,I hate my life,"When I was little whenever I went to school I was genuinely very happy I would play and play do some boring math but PLAY, besides that fact slowly Over the years I’ve lost that feeling and felt like school was taxing on me (I think I’m using that word right). Eventually I moved I begged my parents to move because I just didin’t like we’re I was going so i did and got an new school. Little did I know that it would be what leaded into very dark times for me. For the first few days of the move I didin’t go to school or anything and those were pretty sick days but then school started, on my first day of school my teacher came to greet me and Lead me to class and show me around which was pretty nice of her but anyways I go to class and meet my classmates and sit down and the days go by until I make friends and these friends were great they would be really good friends until I made a joke about my “friends” place which he thought was super mean and I didin’t know that he would react in that kinda way because he would always act like that towards me but when I do it he’d get mad so he dropped me as a  friend OVER TEXT (that kinda hurted me doe) so the next day I go to school and ask him why he didin’t want to be my friend but instead of telling me he just was speechless like I was a ghost and this would kill me and I ended up crying for a long time (by the way he didin’t tell me why he didin’t want to be my friend over the phone so I didin’t know) and when I went to school I went to my other friend who was in the group avoided me too he wouldn’t even say anything which just made everything worse due to the pure fact that I had no friends other than them because the others were just un approachable or would be just complete jerks so I avoided them. Which was horrible for me so then after months the other kid in the group we will call him jack (just a random name I picked) he tells me that the first kid would force him to not interact with me or else he wouldn’t be his friend anymore and he was in my situation to without friends other then him and couldn’t lose any friends otherwise he’d end up like me sitting on a rock by myself for 60 minutes every day at school which killed me inside but was my break from my teacher which we will get into soon. But jack really liked me and wanted to be my friend and couldn’t but once the kid found out he told me this he got super mad at him and I was really mad about that but couldn’t do anything and would want to punch that kid every single day (one day I was about to swing but saw a teacher and backed off) and that’s the end of the kid story but now to the teacher story ( this teacher story starts at the next grade by the way ). This teacher seemed really nice too until a few months passed and I realized how sexist he was (we will get into that later) one day during the rememberince day assembley (don’t know the spelling but it’s a Canadian day we’re we honour fallen soldiers by staying silent for a little while) some kid was crying in the funniest way possible and my one and only friend started laughing at that my teacher came over and told us off in a way that was very wrong for 6th graders (I’m 7th now) and after the assembley we got taken to the guidance counciler for being rude and ever science then he held a grudge on me. After a little while i noticed that these kids who didin’t speak English well would constintly talk shit about people like me in their language and get away with it and when I told someone no one did Anything so instead I ranted about it to my friend and apparently some kid was listening and told on me and got severely punished by my teacher anyways also same thing with girls minus ranting about it. After a bit my teacher started yelling at me instead of doing work and telling me that I have no empathy for anyone and would CONSTANTLY harass me and cried 24/7 an when i told someone about it I just brushed off and one day after school I came home crying super hard and my parents found me crying and instead of hugging me he just yelled at me to man up and after he left I wanted to kill my self so badly (luckily I didin’t follow through just cried like hell) and then when I went to school my teacher made me go to the principles office and read first grader books about empathy and then when I told him that I don’t want to read this and please I just want to go back to regular school he made me go do “volunteer work” at a kindergarten class in the school which was hell because the kids kept on trying to hit me and I have a kind of eating disorder of sorts (not diagnosed but I know I have one) where if I see some food I don’t know or think smells I’d nearly barf and they made me clean up the kids food and I couldn’t but he told me that I’d get suspended if I didin’t so I followed through and nearly barfed like 20 times and 5 were barfs I swallowed and after at my new school (moved again) I got new friends and though everything was good till I realized that people were being blatently racist to me and constantly making fun of me and I realized I have no real friends...

fr4d58,"As much as it sucks to only see one or two people for two weeks (and counting), going to school has made me feel so much more lonely","I think there's a Robin Williams quote saying roughly that it's worse to be with people who make you feel alone than just to be alone. Unfortunately, it definitely resonates with me now. I feel more connected with my online gaming community than spending 7 hours every day treated as a reject by students and teachers alike just for existing. I feel less judged too even. This isn't just a progress  post though. Seeing how few of my acquaintances from school really think to talk is unfortunate, and it reminds me of how I wish I had stayed better at socializing when I peaked at it. Imo, it is a skill that you need to build up. I sleep from 8 A.M to noon on these days off because I have nothing to do. None of these days matter for me.

fr4otu,I lost all my friends because of one mistake,"
My freshman year of college I wanted to make new friends. A fresh new start. I met a group of girls in my freshman dorm. It felt like my life changed for the better. For the first time it felt like I was in a group that I belong. A group that accepted me for who I am. I loved them so much. 

There was a girl in the group, let’s call her Emma, who I had feelings for. This was the first time I ever had feelings for a girl. It was hard to accept them since I came from a very religious background. We were very closed and I was afraid these feelings were going to affect that especially since she had a boyfriend at the time. After Emma broke up with her boyfriend, she came out to me as bi. I felt ashamed that not only was I happy since she broke up with her boyfriend but also that I had a chance with her. I never had a friend like Emma and I didn’t want to ruin it. 

The last days of school before spring break I was sleeping over at her dorm. It was very late. I didn’t know what I was thinking. I told her that I liked her and I didn’t know what to do about it. To my surprised, she liked me back. There was so many emotions that night. I had my first and only experience with a girl that night. 

During spring break she completely ignored my texts. I tried not to think to much of it. I decided we both need some time to figure out everything. When school starts, I noticed that she tried to ignore me when we were in the group. Sometimes pretended I wasn’t there. I talked to her one in one to know what was going on and what was going to happened to us. She told me she got a new boyfriend because she can’t have me. It’s wrong for us to be together. I made her uncomfortable so we couldn’t be friends anymore.

I didn’t know what to do so I told one of the girls everything. That resulted in a big disaster. I kept getting mental break downs every day. It felt like my best friend betrayed me. I would of been okay if she told me I just want to be friends but not only did she get a boyfriend, she made me feel bad for the feelings I had for her. I always been scared of this side of me. I’m pansexual so I am able to be in straight relationships but everything other than that feels shameful to me. That night with her was the first time I was okay with this side of me. 

Mental breakdown after another. No one knew how to deal with me. The girls who I taught were my friends, who I even considered family left me. They stop talking, texting and inviting me. Emma was and is still friends with them. 

A year later I still bump into them and they just ignore me. I want back to just being lonely again but this time I’m afraid of trust. I try to make new friends but I just freak out. I can’t hold conversations.I feel like I deserve to be alone. That everything that happened was my fault. I just would go to class and didn’t talk to anyone else. And now that classes are online I have less social interaction. I wish I could go back and prevent everything from happening. Maybe if I didn’t have these feelings I wouldn’t be so alone.  I wish some one would ask me if I was okay or how was my day. I wish I had some to call a friend again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fr4otu/i_lost_all_my_friends_because_of_one_mistake/,rose_Red57,1,2020-03-29 20:45:45,4,/r/lonely/comments/fr4otu/i_lost_all_my_friends_because_of_one_mistake/,NaN

So I'm in this cycle of loneliness. I'm introverted most of the time, have been since childhood. I've always been okay with being alone. But lately I've been getting extreme waves of loneliness that don't necessarily coincide with bouts of depression, but sometimes its one of the other, ill have extreme lows from depression, then i will come up and loneliness will hit. It's like my body is anticipating to be happy, but my existence forces me not able to be, so I get hit with a BITCH-YOU'RE-STILL-ALONE slap.
I'm 23, never been in a true relationship, I've never had irl friends since middle school, I've been alone since middle school. No siblings at home, no people to relate to at work as the youngest person I work with is 50, no time to meet people because i work all day, no where to go to meet people because i live in the middle of Shit, No Where. I've tried tinder, bumble, but it leads no where, can't wrap my head around the concept of hookups, I'd be terrified.

but obviously isn’t the same. I’ve been trying to keep myself busy but it gets boring so fast. Life is bland as fuck.

fr7ix1,I think my health is beginning to suffer from solitude.,"Ever since this coronavirus situation, I’ve been away from school for nearly two weeks now. It was one of the only things that I looked forward to in my life because of the people and it gave me goals to accomplish, but now that it’s gone I haven’t been able to sleep properly, I’m lonely, I miss the people there (even though I hardly ever talked to them), I’ve been highly stressed and anxious, I feel like I’m about to have a heart attack every day. I’m beginning to become very depressed as well. I have no one at home as my mum goes to work all day every day and there isn’t anyone else. It was fine to be alone for a couple of days but it’s really gotten bad for me now and I don’t know what to do. There was someone at school that I always enjoyed seeing, even if we never talked to each other; but it’s gone now.

fr88li,Practical Guide: How to be more Confident (Part 3: Boundless Confidence),"If you like this post follow [r/Crimsonpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crimsonpill/)

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

Hey guys,

We are trying to have a holistic understanding of Game. We want to target everything that is going to help you become a high-value guy from fashion to nutrition to online behaviors. I see a lot of you making these MASSIVE mistakes, which are **turning you into low-value guys**. Hopefully, these tips serve as a course-correcting for you guys to become high-value guys. Unfortunately, a lot of people who give free advice out there give it without an adequate context. Therefore, one can misunderstand their information.

In this post, I will go more in-depth on confidence, bear in mind that confidence is a vast and complex topic. Therefore, I will have multiple angles on this topic. Today we will be focused on *Boundless confidence.*

**1- Understand that there are various types of confidence, but you want to focus on Boundless confidence**

There are numerous types of confidence. For instance, I believe there's the situational, there's core confidence, and there's boundless confidence. Two weeks ago, we studied situational confidence in which you are good at a specific skill in a given situation. Last week, we studied Core confidence. Core Confidence is your go-to response when doing the ability that you have mastered. This week, we will explore **boundless confidence. Boundless confidence is the confidence to do things that you are have not learned**. Next time we will focus on how to remain confident, despite new obstacles and setbacks.

*What is Boundless confidence?*

**Boundless confidence is to be confident in doing one activity that you have never done before**. For instance, imagine you have always approached girls during the day, but now you want to do it at night time. Most guys will stick to their comfort zone, even the guys who have core confidence since their confidence is limited to their mastery of one skill\*.\* However\*,\* a guy with *boundless confidence will be* **highly adaptable and adjust to his new situation.**

For instance, I remember when I first started going to hostels to do game, it was overwhelming. I was nervous; someone would see me and report me. Bear in mind; I have gotten used to approaching girls *in open spaces*. Therefore, I was shy about approaching. However, I went to the bathroom to wash my hand. I looked myself in the mirror and told myself, *""Come on, you got this.***""**

Once I got out, I started troubleshooting. I scanned the room to find patterns. Note that no one had taught me how to do, 'hostel game.' No one had written a guide to how to approach this unique venue. I had to trust my expertise and take it as a point of reference. After a few minutes, I noticed one crucial similarity. When I'm at the park, and it gets crowded, people never approach me and tell the girl I'm with, ""Are you ok?"" **Most people assume that we both know each other already.** Therefore\*\*,\*\* I took that reference point as an analogous situation. A few hours in, I was feeling very confident and approaching girls at the hostel as if I always did it.

**2-Understand that Boundless confidence means that you have a strong self-belief**

Now that we know what boundless confidence is you need to do some *self-examination,* some guiding questions are: Is there any activity in which I'm the most confident? In which area am I highly capable? **Which area am I an expert? In which area do I trust myself the most?** Maybe you are the most confident at finding your way around a city. Despite how new the city might be, you can take the lead.

**Sample Answer**: *Look! I'm very good at finding myself around anywhere! Drop me in a new city and give me a map and I'll find my way home. Moreover, I'll also discover how to get from the subway to the theme park to the hotel. I won't hesitate. Instead, I will take the map and go to it.*

Take a pen and paper or type in your notes on your iPhone or iPad. *You must go into this self-examination mode*. *Having the ability to look into yourself and determine your strengths is paramount!* Most likely, you have not attained this type of confidence, and I'll show you.

**3-Showing boundless confident sub communicates that you grew up in a positive environment**

Growing up, I realize that the guys who had this boundless confidence also had older brothers or even fathers who were guiding them through the journey. Most likely, you've had parents who were too strict or too neglectful. Whatever the case might be, your **personality is a result of your family and friends.**

Out of all the confidences, situational, and core, your ability to have boundless confidence depends on your environment. Look! You can have situational confidence where you became confident at playing Super Smash Bros. Or you have core confidence since you can beat your friends at Tekken just as much as you can beat then on Smash Bros. **However, if you are put in a novel situation, you will go back to your initial fearful self.**

What distinguishes guys who have boundless confidence from guys who have other types of confidence is that the former will not back down if faced with a novel situation while the latter will.

**4- To have Boundless Confidence shows that you are a natural leader**

There are situational alphas, and they are hardened alphas. **You can see that a harden alpha male, when dropped in a new situation, will learn how to adapt and take the lead.** You might think that this type of alpha is a myth. However, I have seen it myself. For instance, **my sister's ex-boyfriend was in a fraternity, and he was as close as you can get to the harden alpha ideal**.

For example, we went to Times Square to hang out with a group of people. He has never been to New York before; however, he took the initiative and was already leading. I was surprised since I had been to New York before, and yet I did not have this boundless confidence. I was confident I could find anyone at the things I have mastered, but I would have my reservations of leading people in something new.

Afterward, we went for dinner, and we started talking. He told me that he had grown up in a very supportive environment, and that helped him developed this confident personality. I**t is true at this stage, I have surpassed him in both confidence and mastery with girls. However, I still learned from him and other naturals alphas about boundless confidence.**

**5- How you attain Boundless Confidence is a by surrounding yourself with winners**

Now it's likely if you are reading this, you grew up a negative environment or in an environment that was not conducive to you getting boundless confidence. *The people around you made you feel self-conscious or embarrassed.* They told you directly or indirectly, ""**Know your place, dork!** Or **""Stay in your place!"" or ""Haha! Look at you!""** Therefore, you have **developed a reactive personality.** You have been conditioned not to stand out, and each time you have a chance to stand out, you choose not to. For instance, for all, you guys are still fearful of doing photoshoots or taking high-value pictures. The reason you don't do it is **that you are afraid of being judged.**

Similarly, the reason you are not will not take the lead or share is that you are afraid that if you mess up, you will be mocked or laughed up. However, *the only way of leading is to do it and learn as you go. Similarly, the only way of becoming boundless confident is to do it, fail, and do it again. The only way of losing is by not trying.*

Now, if your opportunity to **surround yourself with winners and guys who will push you to greater heights, once** you have that positive environment around you, you will have different conditioning, and you will start to *reprogram both your beliefs and actions.* When you are faced with a new situation that you are unsure of, you will know how to deal with it with high self-esteem and the right course of action.

**Conclusion**

I hope you guys learn from this list. Confidence is a broad topic, but we will be digging into it more and more. Next time we will deal with how to remain confident despite obstacles! Hopefully, you guys can start doing your self-examination as soon as you get the change and reflect on how confident you are and in which situations. Once you know you are already satisfied in one area, you can translate that confidence into another area. Ask yourself:

**""How can I surround myself in a positive environment?""**

**""Once I'm in that environment, how can I contribute to my high-value friends?""**",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fr88li/practical_guide_how_to_be_more_confident_part_3/,Kratz177,1,2020-03-30 01:09:20,0,/r/lonely/comments/fr88li/practical_guide_how_to_be_more_confident_part_3/,NaN

I want someone to destroy my vagina but still love me completely. A two way street. 

In one way I’m so proud of being independent for so long and learning to love myself and focusing on my career. Im not unhappy because I’m single. The hardest part is just lacking intimacy when you want someone to touch you or hold your hand when you need it. I’m not desperate for a guy but I hope it happens one day.

fr9oqz,"Male, 28 years old, single for all of my life.","Hi again reddit

As it says in the title, I am now 28 years old and I have spent all of those years without anyone by my side.

I have never been kissed, and obviously haven't done anything more than that either. I just don't understand what the thing is that has kept me back.

I'm average looking and I try to go out with my friends when I can. 
People always tell me I'm a nice guy. But being a nice guy hasn't gotten me anything.
All I really want is someone to talk to at the end of the day. Someone that cares about how my day went, someone that cares about my feelings and actually wants to listen to me. And more importantly, I want someone that actually shows affection to me. 

My situation hasn't done wonders for my mental health, and a couple of months ago I decided to get professional help. 
Talking with a therapist has been refreshing and she's been a help. She's trying to get me to think about things rationally, which I am usually capable if doing. I know that people like me, that they care about me, but on some days I just can't help to shake that feeling. 

My biggest fear in life is to die alone.
Since turning 28 a couple of days ago, I've been feeling down and this fear has been roaming around in my head.

I'd like to think that my 29th birthday will be a better one, but I doubt it.

fra7su,What's wrong with me?,"I'm (30F) looking for some advice for the following:

I'm single since almost a year now and I feel that I'm running out of time. I would like to have a family and kids some day, but since I'm getting older I feel the pressure to find someone before it's to late. This feeling is getting stronger as I'm now sitting at home without even having a cat to talk to (my house is to small).  

Before this virus I was really close to a burn-out because I was always working or at the gym. Because of this virus I now have time to think about this and it really upsets me. What if I end up alone? Everybody around me is having childern, getting married and my life seems to be so empty at this moment. It's the same routing over and over again. 

I've tried ODA in the past, but I have the feeling that it's not really for me. I'm an introvert person and I have the feeling that I need to 'sell' my self by only showing my best pictures and pretend to be an intresting person. 
Before this virus my colleagues were pushing me every. single. day. to try to have more dates via these apps (just swipe 50 times to the right! You'll get there! yay!). I've had 1 date this year and I really missed some sort of connection so that didn't wrok out.

frbajt,The downside of being an introvert,"I can count how many friends I have on my hand. I met them in my first year of college and before that I didn’t have any friends besides people you saw in high school. Coincidentally, two of my friends came from my hometown which was convenient. Even though I have a small amount of friends, I had many opportunities to make friends in college and through my jobs. People invite you places and show a sudden interest in you, and you them. But then things stop “clicking” and interactions become less natural. I’ve always felt like there was something wrong with me, but really I just hadn’t found who I was yet. I also failed to realize that I am very selective with who I have friendships with, and I used to make the mistake of forcing them even when I didn’t feel comfortable. With my friendships now, it’s as easy as pie and I’m so grateful.

But still I feel lonely. That is the downside to being an introvert and not being able to connect with many people. Yes I love being alone and function better when I have a lot of alone time, but still I feel lonely and wish I could meet more people I had a genuine connection with.

My goal this year is to put myself out there in meetup groups and become healthy and fit. I want to do meditation and heal my mind because I have suffered from depression in the past. I want to enjoy being alone on my own, that way more people will be attracted to me and want to hang out more. And not automatically distance myself from them as a defense mechanism. I need to be at peace with the fact that I am not the outgoing, expressive kind of person, and overall I just need to work on my happiness.

frffi8,Odds at being forever alone?,"With the virus and everyone staying indoors, I’ve felt more alone than I have been in a while. I’m sure the same rings true for a lot of you guys on this sub too. Just speaking with really no intentions for an answer, what are the odds that I **actually** end up forever alone? 

I’m working full time and I live alone in my apartment in the city. I don’t have many friends where I live, but I do have people to do things with from time to time. I don’t go out often, and when I do, I prefer to stick with the friends I go with and not really attempt to try anything with women. I feel like if I’m going drinking with my friends I should give them my attention. People have suggested I go out by myself and try talking to women that way, but I’ve never done it. I do enjoy making conversation and I feel like I’m friendly and don’t come off as off-putting to people, but I just wouldn’t know what to do or say. Maybe when the virus quits I’ll just go. At least I can get some decent drinks if nothing comes of it. 

I don’t use dating apps. I’ve done so in the past, but I hardly got any matches and the ones I did, the conversation never went anywhere. So I said screw it, these aren’t for me. Tinder, Bumble, blah blah blah, they are all shallow anyways and deleting them was necessarily to preserve my self-esteem. 

I take care of myself and how I look physically is a huge part of my life. So I feel like my body is in great shape which makes me happy. I look good and it’s healthy as well; a win-win. I have hobbies that keep me busy and don’t necessarily hate being alone all the time, but the emptiness is definitely there and will continue to eat away at me. 

I can’t magically do nothing and expect someone to come into my life - I have to actively seek people. But I don’t know, maybe it’s just because I have no confidence in talking to women or I’m just not attractive enough and instead I fall into the “average, but I’ll ignore him” category. Sometimes I just feel so hopeless. I want to go through life and experience everything with another person. But I don’t know if that’ll ever happen. My uncle died alone a sad, bitter man who drank himself to death. I don’t want to be like that ever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/frffi8/odds_at_being_forever_alone/,TheLonelySnowboard,1,2020-03-30 08:10:47,2,/r/lonely/comments/frffi8/odds_at_being_forever_alone/,NaN

Hello c: 

I’m a 20 year old American, ive been pretty lonely my whole life but I want to change that , I’m really into video games ; I own a ps4 and a home built PC , and I’m going to be replacing my broken switch soon ! 

I also like to read , I’m currently reading Lovecrafts short stories but we can talk about books together and maybe recommend each other authors and books.

Being an American you can guess I like television and movies a lot , so we can definitely converse cinema together.

friiru,Online Dating Convos,"Tbh I'm done with online dating. It's not even that I don't get matches because I do from time to time, but what bothers me the most is when I match with a girl that puts as much effort in a conversation as she would with her bio.

Ladies seriously if you're interested or not even feeling it then just let us know or don'teven bother matching, if you're interested then put more effort in to it.

frilr7,Widowed in Your 20s Sucks,"I've been a widower for about four years now. I was married to my high school best friend, whose slow deterioration from mental illness eventually claimed her life. I was 24 when it happened.

I've been dating on and off for two-ish years. I'm healed, over the grief, and moved on, but it seems like having lost my spouse categorizes me or something. You can imagine having two kiddos and a deceased wife isn't exactly helpful when you're dating. 

Most nights I lay here by myself after my kids go to bed and just wish for someone next to me. It's funny because I never wanted to be married, but now that I'm not, it's all I want. I want to wake up and see my love next to me, run my fingers through her hair, raise kiddos together, dance in the kitchen while we're making dinner...all that cheesy stuff. 

As if losing my spouse wasn't enough, most of my friends have melted away into the background over the years, too. I feel alone in my town and don't know how to start over.

frisfn,Sucks when you accidentally irritate your only friend/best friend that you have and live with.,"I accidentally irritated my best friend because I didn't want to exit a game the way he kept telling me to because to him his way was more efficient. It might have been I don't know. I just wanted to be in a safer place in the game for when I log back in. I also irritated him by not wanting to go to the store with him and his friend just to pick up alcohol and possibly fast food. I told him I didn't care to go because I wanted to stay home with the cats anyway. I don't get to play games often because I have to use his computer due to me not having one of my own. He doesn't mind me using his computer. So today I figured I'd have it and the bedroom to myself, while he and his friend play in the living room on his friends PlayStation. Now I just feel like an asshole because we argued over me not exiting the game his way and also not wanting to go with him and now I feel completely alone and lonely but then again that's probably just the depression. I appreciate the fact that he wanted me to get out of the house because in general I'm always in the house because I don't like really going outside and that's largely due to my social anxiety. He asked me if I wanted any alcohol or whatever and I told him honestly no I don't care to have any right now because I'm not in that kind of mood and I don't want to be around it. Although I will not stop him from drinking or doing whatever because I'm not that kind of person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/frisfn/sucks_when_you_accidentally_irritate_your_only/,CuteWolfPotato,1,2020-03-30 11:44:22,5,/r/lonely/comments/frisfn/sucks_when_you_accidentally_irritate_your_only/,NaN
frisjk,I don't understand rant,"I have many friends and acquaintances. So why do I feel extremely lonely?

I can honestly tell you that the quantity of friends you have does not matter if you don't have a connection with at least one of them. Like I deal with so much fucking mental shit it's draining. It feels like a knife is repeatedly stabbing me or the rocks get heavier with my great amount of baggage. Like I can't escape. I want to escape this feeling of loneliness but I can't. It's not letting me. And I can't fucking talk about it with my friends because they won't understand what the fuck I'm feeling. 

""Are you okay?""
""What's wrong?""

I simply answer I'm just tired. Because I know that if I do open up about this with my ""friends"" it won't be genuine. It never is. All they care about is themselves. They're all self centered. Nobody gives a shit about anyone. Fake. Fake people around me. 

I want new people in my life. I want to press the restart button and start a new life with more opportunities. 

But I'm so consumed with dark thoughts and being lonely with no one I can trust in my life I feel like what's the point of even trying. Like all the hope is gone.

frjb6t,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music","Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Two weeks ago I was at uni with a busy schedule and now I'm at home all the time.

frkufp,I need a hug,"Hi

I really needed to talk to someone, I've been craving talking and a hug for a while so I decided to come vent here.

Long story short:
-I've been living on my own since I was 7. When I was seven my father pretty much told me I was a shitty child and he wished I was more like my brother who was easy to love. My mother was sexually abusing me so I did a few suicide attempts at 7 years old and after 3 spent my 8th year in observation in a psychiatric ward. Came out that I was just extremely intelligent and had horrible parents.
-lived in 23 different foster houses from 8-15yo including my 11th in Isolation because the child protection services didn't have a place to put me until my 12th anniversary. So never had people close to me, nobody ever got to know me and spent most of my childhood alone eating my way to morbid childhood obesity.
-from 15 to 17 was between apartments and homelessness in Canada's winter.
-on top of that when my mother finally killed herself (after +-50 attempts) her final letter was just hate towards me and making sure everything went to my junkie brother and to blame me (her bastart child as per the will) for her death. Even with all that since my brother who I don't really know is a junkie and couldn't do it, so i paid and organized respectable funerals...
-And my weight has swung with my emotions between 420 and 270 lately I'm on the way down because I am careful at the moment.

After that I fixed my life: when I was 21 finished high school and started college in IT. I started a few businesses in IT, insurance and cars.

So now I am 32:
-If have no family to speak of (only ones still alive are decade long junkies)
-No one really knows of ever knew me,
-If lost most of my friends either when they moved, made girlfriends or I flushed then for being unethical.
-If have never in my life had a functioning normal relationship with another human being...

Lately I realized that I haven't been hugged in years, I don't know if anyone even told me they loved me (even my parents made it clear when I was 5-6 they didn't and where just stuck with kids...) and I really wished I had people that I cared for and cared for me.

Also I the last few years I started hating holidays and birthdays more and more. When I was a kid already birthdays pissed me off because my parents didn't celebrate mine (they did do my brother, even did him twice one year celebrating him on my birthday by mistake...). The last few years I don't even get a phone call of anything for my birthday yet everyone is constantly lived and cherished on Facebook on theirs.

And that's my new thing, seing people's birthdays or love makes me incredibly jealous and then feeling guilty because of being jealous of their happiness. Watching a mother love her child or a happy couple loving each other makes me feel like someone is stabbing me in the heart.

Most people, especially the ones that known me for a long time know I'm an asshole... And I am. When push comes to shove I'll put myself before anyone else without hesitation. I dismiss friends of years for doing things that hurt me. And I firmly believe people change so theres no point in trust because the same people won't be themselves in a few years and will betray you...

Actually most people that don't work for me or have some form of business relationship ignore my calls/messages. But professionally I am well respected but inspire fear because it is know that if you cheat a customer or do something wrong there is no loyalty I will crush you...

And at this point I am successful enough that the last women that got interested in me where there for the wrong reasons. I've never had a reciprocal loving relationship in my life.

So for all my success and intelligence I find my life really sad: I get home and I have no one to talk to. Sometimes I'll think of a funny joke and just start crying when I realize I have no one to say it to. I miss giving a hug so bad sometimes it actually hurts, I think it's been years, last time I got a hug was at a funeral...

Sad thing is I see myself as an amazing person:
-If walk straight: if anything I'm paying for being too honest,
-If never hurt anyone willingly,
-If went from homelessness drop out to university graduate entrepreneur
-went from 420lbs to 270
-if saved a few lives (cpr)

frl419,How to cope with loneliness,I had like 6 or 7 friends at the beginning of the year and most of them weren't even real. They cut me off and I was left with 3 friends. Then later in the year I was talking to the girl that I had known for 2 years and things went well for like a month or 2 and then she lied to me and was talking to this other dude and it was a mess. Bottom line she basically cheated on me and him. This was like 2 months back. I am alone a the moment and it hurts me everyday. Whenever I'm not distracted I feel lonely. I hate feeling deppressed and lonely. Also this quarentine thing is stopping me from making any new friends I probably wouldn't have made anyways. How do I not become dependant on the presents of others. How to get over this feeling of loneliness and deppression. I would love to hear from all of you.

Ive done a DAMN good job improving my life the last few years, I moved out on my own, about finish up college after heading back. I got out of a toxic home environment, worked on myself, learned healthy behaviors. I started learning to recognize what healthy interactions look like, and how to have boundaries.

Ive made SOOOO much improvement. I'm no longer blaming everyone else for all my problems, I try to see what I can do to adjust to a situation rather than just complaining about it.

And you know what? I'm TIRED. I try to be there for people, I'm an ear they can talk to, I go out of my way to understand them and listen. I'm tired of dealing with my shit ALL THE TIME. I know what healthy behavior is, i know what I should do, and by and large throughout my day I do what I should, but then I come home to an empty house and its hard to not wallow. I'm geinuine throughout my day, but in control. Someone my hurt my feelings but if I know they didn't mean it that way, and I know it only hurt because an isecurity i have, then i know I need to behave in a manner consistant with reality , not with my insecurities.

But the feelings are still there. still battling around inside me, I rarely get to express them except in therapy.

I honestly can't stand people in general, theres a few people that I tolerate but the the majority of people I can't stand whatsoever. The worst part is that the people I do tolerate have friends who are garbage human beings. All my life iv been the black sheep of the group, a punching bag if you may. I'm always the go to when it comes to putting someone down. My parents aren't great people either, my mother gets on my nerves constantly with every little thing, and my father pushes my buttons to the point of me being on the verge of having an angurisum because he enjoys doing that to people. Iv got no on in my life that I care about and no one cares about me. Iv never been in a proper relationship, the closest thing being having intercourse with a guy that I fucking despise and the only reason he had sex with me was because he's a cum brain sex addict who used me acts like it's his first time but he's definitely been with other men.  I don't feel like I'll ever be in a proper relationship because the men I do like end up being straight and I can't stand men with a hint of being flamboyant which really narrows the dating pool. I can't tell most of my ""friends"" I'm gay because they'll just think of the stereotypes. I don't fit into the gay community because I hate everything flamboyant and I old unpopular views.

My friends who are girls talk about them calling each other and just letting all the tears and pain out in an ugly wailing cry. To be honest everyone needs those ugly cries to really release the waterfall of emotion. A lot of times if I do get to ""edgy"" as my friends call me I'll try taking to one of them but I just end up hurting them. 
I've learned that all the people who say they will be your ""rant buddy"" they don't care about you, they are just curious about your problems. I've learned to keep mouth shut. 
I look back at old pictures of me and my old love. I keep them to help me remember how beautiful love is but to also remember how I once was before the shit hit the fan.

IT'S NOT REAL. Yeah some people are in a better phase in their lives than you but it's a fairytale. People only upload the good parts of their life never the bad. Not the heartbreaks, their faces in the morning, the loneliness, the sadness. They show you what they want you to see and yes I too am guilty of this. Even you, you mostly talk about your problems here because you are anonymous right? I am willing to bet most of you wouldn't dare say the things you say here on your Facebook page. Yet when someone looks at your Facebook page they might think you are okay, maybe even living a great life if your latest posts was that concert you went to or that trip to that place.

After she left today i felt as terrible as i didnt for quite a while. right now i only see a couple of options for me, ether break the contact with her completely hoping i will forget her fast, which is highly unlikely. Or i could try pushing through feeling absolute miserable ( but i dont know if i am actually capable of doing so ) basically trying to telling her everything i just wrote down but i dont see where that leads and i cant think of any positive outcome.

frytmw,I'd have completely given up by now if it wasn't for instinct.,"Things have been progressively getting worse, despite my every effort to change the things and I *can* and accept the things I *can't.*

As a male nearing 30, I've just about given up. I haven't had a romantic partner in TEN years. I've had two casual hookups, one of which was extremely toxic and destructive. Other than that, nothing. I've been lead on numerous times, and outright rejected more times than I'd like to admit. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of playing the game, but I can't for the life of me imagine being alone for the rest of my  life. 

It is extremely hard to believe that my situation isn't hopeless.  I feel like I am trying to sell one of those tiny electric cars, the kind that would resemble a ball of reynolds wrap after an accident, in a rural mountain town where everyone drives four-door diesel pickups.  I've cleaned the exterior, and detailed the interior the best I could. Ive added accessories, upgraded the software, even went as far as pricing below market value in my opinion. Hell, this car even knows a second language, cooks, and loves to travel the world (ha ha)! But there aren't any buyers. No one seems to be looking for this type of car. I've had interested customers, some even took it for a test drive. Others have called to set up an appointment only to cancel at the last minute. All the while, cars are driving off other lots with happy new owners one after another.  And when you confide in others about your problem selling this car, their advice is to not ""try to sell the car"", or ""there's a car out there for everyone"", etc platitues etc. 

I'm short. Like, *very* short. Not the meme short where you're just under the golden 6ft. I'm standing tall at 5'1. This is the ""what went wrong/feel bad for/I don't want those genes"" range as I think of it. I'm not ugly, and actually in the best shape of my life. But my experiences have lead me to believe that  this is the largest wrinkle on my shirt so to speak.  I also have a very alienating/socially unaccepted past time. I love to ride freight trains. It's a passion of mine that I can't give up because it's one of the very few things I look forward to. But it's only a couple weeks out of the year. It's by no means a way of life for me. 

But it's not all rain and clouds, I am confident who I am and what  I stand for, and truly believe I have a lot to offer. 

I've always had a hard time dating/hooking up, and quite frankly I am surprised I had the opportunities  I did. But I  cannot seem to find a partner, a life companion. Someone to experience this ""experience"" with. 

But again, I'm exhausted. I feel beat up. My confidence and self esteem are really taking a toll as the losses pile up.

frzunk,Feel depressed af because of wasted potential,"I'm an 18-year-old guy. I've had social anxiety for as long as I can remember, but It is undiagnosed. I've done everything to get acquaintances. I'm already a good looking guy. I always cared about my academic performance and did really well in school. I work out, and am quite fit, have a six-pack, can run marathons. I have a strict diet and barely eat anything unhealthy. I'm charismatic and my social skills are great. But I can't utilize them. I've been pressured by my parents to get a wife and kids, but I doubt that will ever happen. It's not about looks, it's almost all personality. My social anxiety is holding me back so badly and has done it my whole life. I feel like this has started to create other mental health issues for me too. I, for example, am really worried about becoming depressed. Because, despite my social anxiety, I'm pretty extroverted. I want to have friends, I never did, and I got bullied in school. I'm trapped in my house. I never leave at all. No one ever messages me, except long-distance girls, but I don't want long-distant relationships. I want someone that I can actually meet in real life and hang out with. I feel like my life, so far, is totally wasted potential and I feel like this is making me really mad at everyone and I don't like it.

Ive shut myself away from friends and family, the pressure had got to me a little bit and now I feel alone also.

fs21vt,What if COVID-19 social distancing makes people less lonely?,"I'm currently writing a book about loneliness and ran across some interesting research that made me wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing will make some people feel less lonely and improve some people's mental health. I've been reading stories in this subreddit for a while and thought it'd be fun to test my theory with all of you. I write freelance for magazines like The Atlantic and Quartz and would love to write up a story if I hear some interesting stories. 

But first here's the research that got me thinking about this in the first place: 

**The research**

In the middle of the 20th century a man named Charles Fritz began to study the relationship between disasters and mental health. During World War II, Fritz arrived in England expecting a society in distress. But instead of finding a nation in hysteric panic, Fritz arrived to “a nation of gloriously happy people, enjoying life to the fullest, exhibiting a sense of gaiety and love of life that was truly remarkable.” Later in the war Fritz studied this phenomenon for the US Army. In order to do that he gathered more than 70 volumes of existing research on the impact of war on civilian populations. He learned that his anecdotal observations in England represented a broader truth: war seemed to improve mental health. 

Researchers have noted the same surprising observations all around the world. In the 1917 Russian Revolution, one researcher wrote that ""obsessional psychoneuroses” became extinct. Reflecting on his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, a psychiatrist wrote, “I had the impression that many depressed and other mentally ill people were better when confronted with the actual demands and situations that arose during the war than when they were concerned with their own conflicts.” The same observations would later be reported following civil wars in Algeria, Lebanon, and Northern Ireland.

After the war, Fritz led the most comprehensive study of natural disasters and mental health ever conducted. During this period he developed his theory of the “community of sufferers.” He noticed that in peaceful societies people with mental illnesses suffer alone. The distress of their inner world doesn’t match the apparent equanimity of the society they live in. As a result they suppress their emotions and rarely talk about their feelings. Wars and disasters create a natural remedy, a sort of forced therapy. Suddenly everyone suffers and speaks openly about their pain and trauma. As he wrote, “Modern societies have perhaps become ‘sick’ societies not because the stresses of life have become more intense or numerous, but because they become absorbed by the individual as an unshared experience.” During times of public distress, suffering becomes a shared experience. As a result rates of mental illness go down. 

**My hypothesis** 

On the surface, it may seem logical to predict that a pandemic like coronavirus will make more people depressed, lonely, and anxious. But if people react like they do during times of war or natural disasters we shouldn’t be so quick to draw that conclusion.

In my research I've discovered that there's a big difference between temporary loneliness and chronic loneliness. The former is what people feel when they travel alone, move to a new city, or break up with a partner. But it usually doesn't last long and rarely leads to prolonged rumination and self-doubt. The latter is what people feel when they come to believe they don't belong anywhere, they are destined to be lonely forever, or they somehow deserve to not be loved. (I realize that's a broad simplification, but hopefully you get the picture). 

I think some people will feel temporary loneliness that otherwise wouldn't have if it weren't for COVID-19 and social distancing. But I think there might be a large group of people who feel less of the pain associated with chronic loneliness and the depression that often follows. In my experience part of the pain of loneliness is knowing that I should be doing something else. I've felt most lonely on weekends because I've felt like I should be out at the bars or hanging out with friends. So I wonder if some people will feel less lonely because the obligation to go out has been temporarily removed. 

I also wonder if some people who felt lonely will suddenly have more people around given that more people are working from home. In the past I've felt lonely because I work from home alone and often times went 10+ hours without talking to anyone. But now my house is always filled with life because my roommates are working from home. 

I don't think we'll be able to accurately say whether, on the whole, more or less people feel lonely or be able to measure the degree to which that loneliness has changed. So the goal of my research isn't to figure that out. I just want to challenge the surface-level argument that everyone will feel more lonely. 

**What do you think?**

Does anyone here feel less lonely than they did in the past? Does anyone feel more lonely?

fs2lpr,"Loneliness is Palpable - this post is so long, I'm so sorry","A year ago, I broke up w/ narcissistic, cheating ex. If you've ever dealt with a narcissist, then you have an idea of what kind of person they were.  We were together for a long time, were engaged, etc... Emotional abuse became normalized over time &amp; I feel they destroyed everything that was good within me. A month or so ago, I found an amazing ASMR voice actor/actress.  Their audios threw into sharp relief everything that I was missing in my previous relationship and magnified the abuse I sustained.  The audios I found started to help combat the loneliness while simultaneously making me feel hopeless bc that kind of ideal in a partner is completely nonexistent.

I think because every single person on this Earth craves that deep down kind of love shown in those audios.  To be utterly consumed by it and to have that love reciprocated.  The other types of love in the world don't always encompass that ideal and it becomes undesirable through which to live vicariously.

And I get that these audios are meant to be immersive and the character is whoever you want it to be, and not meant as some kind of cure all. I found an online community of fans/supporters of this ASMR person and while they're really nice, I still don't feel like I fit in.  I joined the community bc I believed that I would find people that I could be friends with.  But, a lot of them are so much younger than I am and I hate to say it but there are a few cliques that have formed.  I just think... wtf, I'm a grown ass person who doesn't have time for that.  But the truth is, I do.  I *do* have time for all of it because I am so very alone.  I've tried different venues and forums trying to make friends but haven't had a lot of luck.  Different things keep getting in the way.  Example: almost everyone in that community is playing AC so when we all gather to hang out with one another and the ASMR person, it's just them all playing AC together.  There are a few of us who don't have switch's so we can't partake.  I know it may seem silly... it just makes the goal of friendship seem more isolating.  I get that befriending people on discord or reddit/imgur can take time but when you're this lonely, you feel that you don't have the kind of time to waste on waiting for people to be your friend.

I don't know if any of you have ever felt the physical pain of loneliness/depression.  This devouring chasm in your chest, the hollow cavern of your entire body, the heady realization that no one can help you.  My only hope is to keep trying to connect with people and just hope that one day, they'll realize how fucking amazing I am.   Such false bravado I'd like to believe.  Stay safe out there, yall.

It's like, even when someone seems to genuinely care, I just can't bring myself to do the same. I can't care for anyone or anything anymore. The one person I ever did care about, bailed, like I said.

So, what's the point of even getting outta bed anymore? I have tried all that, find purpose on your own, or have fun with yourself bullshit. It's a fuckin scam. It only works until you realize that no one would notice if you up and died right then and there.

All I have ever done for anyone is try and be the one who's there for them, yet the moment I need them, they either bail, or hijack the conversation to talk about them some more. Every. Fucking.

fs36kh,29M [an interesting title],"29M [an interesting title]

Hello all. Debated on posting on here for quite some time. Figured I’d give it a go. I don’t know what the accepted way of having a social media friend is (idk what discord is).

29M. Midwest US.

In a relationship that has its ups and downs just like anyone else. 

Mall public safety officer for now (cue the Paul blart jokes) but was just hired as a youth counselor at a school for troubled teenagers.

Type 1 diabetic since 2003. 

I used to work out quite a bit and was in really great shape until said relationship.

I don’t have best friends in “real life” so to speak- I’ve always been a loner. But I’ve worked as a DJ, wedding coordinator, public safety officer, mental health professional, car sales, etc etc.

In my free time i like to play guitar, write my own music, read dystopian fiction, binge watch Netflix (designated survivor, TWD, stranger things...) i do play PS4 but i don’t do the online stuff. I’m kind of old school. I play the story mode in games. A huge God of War fan.

But there’s a huge loneliness factor. I would like to someone to talk to, text with, Snapchat with (that is not me saying i want a “relationship” or trade nudes or flirt with anyone). Just someone to talk to. Someone like minded (I’m all over the place politically). 

Someone who likes to be fit and workout. Someone who is a go getter, can be motivated but also understands that life just effing sucks sometimes. Memes, dark cruel humor (we all have our coping mechanisms). Someone who is just super chill to talk to.

I do get along better with females, I’ve never been able to have a male friend really but I’m not opposed to talk to guys either. I’m not an alpha male type, I’m just a guy who goes to work and goes home and that’s it.

But someone who can help motivate, talk about music, their life, different beliefs, etc. i don’t mind texting or snapping or trading Instagram or social media stuff at all. 

Hopefully i meet someone(s) cool? Have a great day :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fs36kh/29m_an_interesting_title/,jakerz40cal,1,2020-03-31 09:53:50,2,/r/lonely/comments/fs36kh/29m_an_interesting_title/,NaN

fs5g7y,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music","Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

fs5zmd,I feel deeply depressed and have nobody to talk to about it,"I've been isolated for some time. The corona virus has not impacted my life one bit. I have mental health issues that make me terrified to talk to strangers. I have locked myself indoors for years. All my friends I had in my life from before the mental illness manifested have jumped ship. They ignore my messages so I don't even bother messaging them anymore. Even my old therapist who asked to stay in touch ignores me that's how much of a loser I am.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think to myself how do I pull myself out of this mess? I try to get a therapist, they don't understand me or help me. They make me wait a full year of my time before actually setting up phone call sessions. (i get a therapist off the NHS for free.) By the time I get the new therapist i realize they don't really want to help me, they don't care if I tell them how miserable I am. They just want me to fill in a questionnaires over the phone so they can tick boxes. I am not a regular person in a regular situation so i found the sessions incredibly unhelpful. After the 9th time of her canceling my sessions because of either sickness / holiday and multiple 10 min late calls / 20 min early ending of sessions I gave up. I cut contact with her, her email to me was as cold as I felt she had been throughout our sessions together. I realized there wasn't anyone to help me anymore and therapy isn't an issue. I wont be waiting another year for another sucky therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to try to do something with my life. I am a gamer who relies on distractions within the home to keep myself ""sane"". I gave up on getting a switch console for my final birthday present before being considered ""too old"" for an expensive present off my parents. I gave up the switch to get a good camera for taking macro shots.

&amp;#x200B;

I started a youtube channel in hopes I could earn enough ad revenue to become self supporting. I planned that I would make videos about my passion (ecospheres). Every so often i would leave the house with my mom. I would go to a lake or whatever to film a video. I would spend a lot of time editing thumbnails and the video itself, but i lacked any previous experience. My content got better with each video, but i had nobody to share my journey with.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached 100 subscribers recently. I had no friends to tell, but it felt like a massive deal to me. I don't think I'll ever be a big channel on youtube or that I'll ever succeed enough to be able to support myself financially. It was a desperate attempt at trying to save myself because I had no options left. I pretty much ran out of options, so tried something different. It wasn't the typical path for someone trying to get help, but it was the path I chose.

&amp;#x200B;

I predict in the future my journey on youtube will be as lonely as my life so far. I haven't anyone i can talk to about making content, thumbnails or who's even interested in what I do. I have a lot of channels comment on my videos who later end up uploading their own videos with similar thumbnails or videos. It makes me feel dread in case they succeed and i don't. This is pretty much my last chance at life. I have put my final egg in the only basket i have.

&amp;#x200B;

My sleeping pattern is screwed because I can't concentrate on sleep anymore. I feel under a lot of pressure to succeed. If I fail I'll never get out of this mess. My mess is pretty much being trapped in my own home, completely dependent on my parents for everything and not being able to work because I'm terrified of strangers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fs5zmd/i_feel_deeply_depressed_and_have_nobody_to_talk/,UnhappyTurtle96,1,2020-03-31 13:00:29,2,/r/lonely/comments/fs5zmd/i_feel_deeply_depressed_and_have_nobody_to_talk/,NaN

Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embarrassment I have around it after I get off.

fs83kf,I talk to my dog when I’m at the park with him.,"I just realized how weird this is today, as I got strange looks from people. I do it almost subconsciously. I talk to my dog a lot. At home I’m more comfortable because I don’t feel the prying eyes and judgements of others. I’ll tell him how much I love him. If I’m having a rough day, I’ll remind him that everything will be alright. If something triggers his anxiety, I rush to soothe him and tell him everything’s okay. When he lays in my lap I tell him how pretty and sweet he is. How I like the texture of his fur. If he looks worried I check in with him, asking if everything is alright. I often times ask for his input on matters. “What do you think about x?” And, no matter his answer, I usually answer with “Me too.” There’s no way I’m going to disagree with my little puppa. He has good, wise judgement that I trust haha. 

Welp. I’ve been quarantined for a long time (parks are the only thing open where I live), and decided to take my dog to the park as a little treat. I kind of forgot that you’re *not* supposed to talk to animals in public. As we walked I talked to him, mostly about dog stuff. Asking him what he thought of people playing tennis. Pointing out the cute girl dogs I saw or warning him when a big dog was headed our way. Telling him how uncomfortable the droves of shirtless, running men made me feel. Asking him what he saw in the woods and what he was sniffing at. Talking to him about how gross it is that some pet owners don’t clean up after their dogs. I love him to bits and pieces, and I’m so embarrassed, but some days, I feel like he’s all I have that’s safe and gentle. He’s never tried to hurt me. He has trauma (like me), which can make him a little bitch (pun not intended). He sometimes snaps at people, but he’s always immediately sorry about his knee-jerk reactions, trying to make up for it with cowering kisses. In spite of all he’s suffered, he’s still lovable somehow. He gives me hope that I can be lovable someday, too. 

So if you see some wack ass lady talking to her dog in the park, please don’t stare loathingly. Just move along. She might be lonely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fs83kf/i_talk_to_my_dog_when_im_at_the_park_with_him/,coffeenpills,1,2020-03-31 15:48:09,2,/r/lonely/comments/fs83kf/i_talk_to_my_dog_when_im_at_the_park_with_him/,NaN

I don't understand how I am supposed to talk to others yet I feel like this.

I don't know what to do other than fill my schedule with work to avoid feeling like this. Sometimes i just don't want to live and the thought of exiting life peacefully or even violently doesn't scare me as much as it used to.

Saying that sounds super dramatic but it's how I feel at the time. Do I say it and cause fear for my friends and family, possibly end up in a mental ward like my uncle, and ruin my senior year of college.

Or I could keep quiet and suffer without causing any of the before mentioned.

fs8hno,Never should've reached out,"I wish I shouldn't have talked to people again, been living as a recluse i could only afford online friendships, relationships or what's you call it. Wish i kept it for myself and continued on, cause no matter how many people I come across, those end leaving me hurt and broken into pieces and taking a part of me and tossing it into the unknown. Loneliness is better suffering to deal with rather than that, cause after sometime, you'll be content and there's no unexpected pain that can arise. But I still can't stop longing for it, I have to stop for my own sake, I'm holding myself together with whatever leftover pieces I have, can't gamble them all away thinking this time it would be different, this time I won't be left broken. I should've never reached out, I regret it, I'm back to being lonely now, back home, it feels comforting and like nothing else, or no one else can hurt me. I don't wanna leave.  
Idk what's wrong with me or why do I always get close to people who leave me broken, intentionally or unintentionally, but it happens anyways, and I push away other people who haven't done anything cause I'm scared they'll break a part of me. It takes so long to heal after being broken and I'll broken into 3 pieces while healing for that lost part.
I'm not looking for new people, I'm sharing just in general, so I can subconsciously know that someone knows my pain, like as in general, not sharing to any specific person and start going again only to be crushed.

I should've never reached out again,  I recoiled back home, to the pain I have been used to but it hurts more for each time I recoiled back.
I know I'm not making any sense, just want to put it out there and console myself, someone knows, don't worry about it.

Like when I did have some hope I was around trying to meet someone and date but it was it never happened, I never feel a good vibe when meeting a girl, but the opposite, girls I really like usually were already in a relationship, no one ever introduce me to anyone, nights out were a complete waste of time, no matter how many classes like dance/theater/etc I went, just no girl ever. No online daring results, or bad results with matches.

So I kind of gave up, not completely, but i almost stop going out on weekends, i was tired of putting so much effort in being presentable just to be always ignored and left aside.

So after all these processes I kind of lost track of time.

Now I’m trying to collect myself, I feel lonely and depressed as always in those years, but I gave up some bad habits that ""help me"" in the past.

I was doing kind of good, and now this pandemic, I talk more to myself in order to not loose my mind. I feel like a part of me just want to jump of the window, I don’t think I would ever do something like that, but I have the urge or fantasy of jumping, and I have to commit some mental strength to talk that idea off, that’s what bothers me.

I was doing really ok, but now I can’t sleep, I have insomnia.

Two last relationships I sabotaged, or I did t fight for them, as I thought i could do better or just find another girl.

fsaz9i,Just a little advice,"I see a lot of people on here who are having problems dealing with rejection. I used to be one of them. The best lesson I ever learned is that people have the right not to want to be your friend and their reasons are none of your business. When I was young I used get angry and ask myself why someone ghosted me or didn’t want to hang out with me and feeling like they had no good reason for it. Well they do have a reason, and that reason may not make any sense to you, but it makes sense to them. Let them go. Move on. Don’t be creepy. I have rejected friendships myself and some of the reasons were mostly personal and nothing to do with the other person at all. Maybe the reason was rooted deeply in some personal issue that the person unknowingly triggered in me, or I just wanted to be alone. After realising that I don’t own the right to anyone’s else’s time, space or choice of company or an explanation for it, I have been much happier and less hurt by rejection. And in turn it has strengthened my ability to choose my friends more wisely without felt guilty about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsaz9i/just_a_little_advice/,cobbbwebbbs,1,2020-03-31 20:04:11,8,/r/lonely/comments/fsaz9i/just_a_little_advice/,NaN

fsdj6o,Slowly deteriorating Self-Esteem and Confidence. Loneliness is killing me. How can I make my life improve from this point.,"Slowly deteriorating Self-Esteem and Confidence. Loneliness is killing me. How can I make my life improve from this point.

Since a young age I’ve been made fun of every aspect of myself. My forehead, my nose, my lips, my dark skin, my hair, etc. I’m sure everyone has went through some sort of name calling at a young age. But for me in particular, it was virtually everyday. I was considered pretty funny in high school and I would usually make fun of myself to hide the fact that I didn’t like being constantly made fun of. I couldn’t get away from these comments unless I distanced myself away from the people I talked to. I did and the loneliness I felt when I was with my friends only multiplied. 

I’ve been trying to learn how to make new friends, but it hasn’t been easy. On the outside to people it may seem that I don’t have much trouble talking to people and could even be sociable. But being so alone is taking a toll on me mentally. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. It just kills my mood for the rest of the day. I have high expectations of myself and am trying to made stride to meet my goals but all of this stuff is just a huge roadblock for me. 

I’m now currently in a community college and I haven’t made any friends, only a couple of acquaintances. It helped my loneliness when I could go on the campus near other people. I felt less alone. Even though I had almost no interaction with them, it felt better because I wasn’t by myself. I’ve tried to learn to love exterior self but it’s had been so hard. I’ve been called ugly so many times in my life. To be honest I don’t even think I am. When I look in the mirror, it isn’t even that bad. But what people have told me through out my younger years still prevents me from feeling good with the way I look. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m mentally breaking down to extreme levels.

fsen3u,Feeling empty and realizing how lonely I am,"I recently got accepted to an art school after passing the entrance exam. I was extremely happy at first, since I could now quit my job and finally focus on something that I enjoy doing. But suddenly, for no reason, it hit me. This shitty empty feeling inside of me was there again. And it's making me angry, sad, and frustrated at the same time. Because I'm supposed to be happy. 

But I just feel lonely. All my friends are gone. I don't have any friends anymore. Not in real life, and not even online. And I'm still young. I'm turning 17 in a few months. So I don't think that I should already be feeling like this. It just started with not having friends after I finished school. And to this day I don't understand why people just decided to simply not care anymore. It's not that hard to stay in touch these days. But they simply didn't care. I tried to also not care. ""This is fine, I enjoy being alone."" And I did. I could always be myself when I'm alone. I still had some friends online too, so I wasn't completely lonely. But they also decided to not care anymore. And to simply cut me off. Because it's easier to do that instead of staying in touch. So now I was completely lonely. My daily routine changed. Instead of being with friends or talking to them (doesn't matter if irl or just chatting online), I now had to find ways to waste my time. Listening to music, playing videogames, drawing, watching Youtube, looking at memes. The usual stuff. But the usual stuff now sucked. It's not the same anymore. Because I feel empty. Because I miss my friends. And I hate being lonely. I want to be with people so badly. I sometimes find myself scrolling through old messages. And I miss those times. Because I wasn't lonely back then.

I also want to be loved. Saying that I just want a girlfriend seems dull. That's not it. I want someone who can fill this empty feeling in my head and stomache. But not just a friend. A person who is special to me, and vice versa. Someone who I can trust and build a deep, romantic connection to. Someone who is always there for me, and someone who I can be there for.

Typing my thoughts out makes me feel pathetic. It's hard to talk about this mess, which is one of the reasons why I keep all of this inside of me instead. I'm just hoping that things will change at some point in my life. I don't want to be lonely anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsen3u/feeling_empty_and_realizing_how_lonely_i_am/,AtomicHZRD,1,2020-04-01 00:13:40,2,/r/lonely/comments/fsen3u/feeling_empty_and_realizing_how_lonely_i_am/,NaN

fsh57e,I don't know how to have lasting friendships,"I don't have any childhood friends. Any close friend I've ever had has left my life after a couple of years. I have plenty of friends now as an adult but they're all surface level and I'm afraid to get close to any of them because everyone I get close to leaves. 

The pattern seems to be that I hit it off with a friend, they come to me with their problems and I listen. Then if I reach out with my problems, I either get steamrolled, (Usually a quick, ""that sucks"" before changing the conversation to a problem they're having without asking me if I'm okay, if I wanna talk about it, etc) they help me talk through the problem but start reaching out to me less and less, or they tell me I'm overwhelming them with my problems and cut ties completely. 

I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD from familial abuse so I know my problems can be heavy. I go to therapy and I really try to be mindful about not sharing anything that could be better handled by a mental health professional. But no matter what, confiding in people seems to be what kills my relationships. 

It's not even like my friendships are all just about venting. I like to have fun and go out and just talk about silly things with people. But to me, the level of trust and intimacy to be able to reach out for a shoulder to lean on is crucial to have a close friendship and I just can't seem to get that right.

fshoy4,I feel pathetic,"This is just a rant of my random thoughts. I dunno. I don’t have anyone to say it to. I’m sorry if this isn’t okay. 

Any amount of niceness from anyone results in attachment that I know isn’t mutual, and it hurts. 

Talking to someone and seeing them actively ignore things you’re saying, only even pretending to listen because they feel bad.. that fucking sucks. It’s more upsetting than just completely being ignored.

I’m still coming to terms with the fact that I am disabled. I’ve talked with my therapist about the obvious — money problems, not being able to do things I used to do. Stuff like that. But I haven’t (because it’s embarrassing) mentioned how much more lonely it’s made me feel. It’s not like I would go out and try to meet people before, but now I don’t even have the option. I can’t go out. I feel like it was just the final nail in the coffin of potentially finding someone to care about me

I’ve been struggling a lot lately. Relapsing with self harm and my eating disorder. More scars and being fatter just makes me even more unlovable. My therapist likes to say “Why does it matter what you look like? You don’t go out, nobody even sees you”, and I get that she’s just trying to get me to stop worrying about other people and work on self love, but it just makes me feel like shit.

I hate everything about myself. I know it’s a common saying that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else.. if that’s the case, I’m going to die alone.

I’ve been in two relationships before, but both were extremely abusive and left me with lots of trauma. I can’t imagine what it’s like to be with someone that isn’t abusive like they were.

It always makes me upset when internet strangers say they care about you.. you don’t know me, you can’t possibly care about me. 

I just.. I wish I could have one person that cares. That truly loves me. But I don’t think that will ever happen",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fshoy4/i_feel_pathetic/,radnuggets,1,2020-04-01 02:57:12,1,/r/lonely/comments/fshoy4/i_feel_pathetic/,NaN

fsislm,Lonely in the time of COVID-19 (F/20s/US),"Prior to the pandemic, I had a decently active social life and was beginning to form and strengthen friendships. However, since the pandemic arose, I find this time of social distancing especially difficult because I live completely alone. I am finding myself super jealous of people with roommates or living with a loving partner, and despite my confidence, focus on my career, and independence I don’t have either. It is possible to be a very self-loving person but not draw people in, and as an extrovert, I find it unbelievably depressing to be spending this much time alone. I am complete without anyone else, but it is human to desire companionship, both platonic and romantic.
I do put things into perspective. I am aware that there are plenty of people stuck with an abusive person and that is truly horrifying and I wish I could do something to stop that for others. Having toxic relatives, I am grateful not to be around others who bring me down and/or treat me poorly. I also am very grateful to have a stable, meaningful career job, and therefore, a steady income. I have my health, which is perhaps the most important thing. I try my best to focus on all of this.
But I’m very sad and this is really getting to me. People who are quarantined with good, friendly, healthy people (in whatever capacity, including a kind roommate) are super lucky.

I wish I could explain it better but over text it's difficult.  So I have to sit here go to work 35 hours a week. Pay the phone bill for 3 other people, mine and dads car insurance,  internet bill and THE ENTIRE RENT. While they get to sit here In the house. They don't ever thank me. I barely make enough to pay for all that, I can't Ever save money to buy something I want. I've been trying to save up for a new piano which is around 2800 dollars. It's expensive but it's something I want and need.  I'm doing all this by myself, I don't get help not from anyone.  The thing is that they know I'm the only one with a job and they still don't bother to go out and look for a job. All the expenses for us should be about 300 each and that's including rent so it should be around 300 per person. Our monthly payments for all the bills is around 1000. But nope I have to pay all that by myself,  mind you i only make minimum wage. So there's all that I have to deal with. I hate that I know my dad has been a hardcore alcoholic for 21 plus years, ever since I've been alive he's been doing that. And I hate the fact I'm saying this but he won't ever stop. He's gonna continue to drink and drink forever. He doesn't want to get help, he thinks it's a waste of time. So my dad is gonna be a alcoholic for the rest of his life, which absoulety kills me. I wish he could be sober and live a normal life. I've seen him do some fucked up things will I was growing up and it was all over because of that beer. My dad is great dad when he is sober, he is awesome, like seriously he's the best dude I ever met, anytime I needed something he's been there, But that addiction he has ruins everything. Lately over the last year  he's been drunk more than he has sober. And I have to deal with it and pick up the pieces. I don't mind paying rent or bills. But when I have to pay all of them, and he just sits there and drinks, my half brother lays on the couch 25/8, and I never have money to save up to get something for myself. I'm so drained, and on top of that I don't have any friends. They abandoned me, stabbed me In the back and left me. My phone is constantly dry and never has any texts. My body is starting to shut down from lack of love. And I hate myself and I never have had a girl like me back. I have been rejected by every girl I like. I am in this by myself, I don't think I'll ever be happy. I'll be single forever and having to deal with this shit, self esteem issues, drunk father, bills,  rejection, the fact I'll remain single forever, never have anything I want. If this is how my life is ment to be then I don't know if I'll make it.  If this is all there is for me then it's not gonna work, and I'm scared that this is my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fskeg2/drained_long_post/,rx9ue,1,2020-04-01 05:17:38,3,/r/lonely/comments/fskeg2/drained_long_post/,NaN

fsl8wf,Alone. Unhappy. Bored. In lockdwown. I always feel like I'm a terrible person.,"*I'm a 16 year old male... I'm based in the UK.*

The only social interactions I had with other people was at school but now I'm in lockdown, I have nobody. I do speak to one guy online (discord) who I'm great friends with but he's not usually online.

I'm bored. I honestly do school work all day, from when I wake up and throught out the day - when I become too tired and go to bed...

I'm unhappy. I can't describe how I feel. It's just a feeling of nothingness. Just - no joy, nothing. I feel down all the time - there are some rare moments when I laugh...

Finally... I feel like I'm a terrible person. I've not killed anyone, I've not hurt anyone, I've not comitted a crime. Things I've said to people in the past, people I've pushed away - I look back on it now, regretting everything. I regret my entire childhood. I only focused on work. I never had fun. I never had a childhood. Never invited to a party, never had a first kiss, never been in a relationship. I spoke to my crush over insagram and told her my feelings - she said ""that's so sweet, thank you"" and that's it. I'll never see her again - we're going to different schools.

I have an urge to hug someone but nobody to hug. Sure, my parents are there for me but that's all...

Also - I don't remember the last time I cried. I think I'm physically incapable... No matter what the situation is, even when a loved one passes away - I show no emotion.

fsm0hf,Can't seem to make close connections? Giving up...,"Is it me or just society in general? There has to be a way


I lost most of my friends after high school and a deppression. 

But for the last 2.5 years I have been feeling good, and I have been trying to make new friends and self development. (Went abroad, travelled, went to a new school, new jobs, new hobbies) Took chances like people say you have to. But I never meet people I feel connected with. I only get acquatiances. I'm ""friends"" someone while i'm e.g. attending the same school course. 

I'm a female, introverted, but I used to have friends. I'm not an open book, but i'm not closed either. I just need more time to open up. I really make an effort into getting to know people. And I'm a good lisentner... But nobody wants to be my fucking friend. 
I sirencly don't understand why it has to be this difficult. 

I have accepted that I might have to live years like this, and learned to enjoy my own company. But It still bugs me everyday. I feel so lost. Having been around so many new people the last years, without a single close new friend makes me extremtly conscious about myself. I'm starting to feel that something is truly wrong with me, but I honestly wont allow myself to think like that, since I don't want to get into deppression again... I finally accepted myself... 

But I'm just so tired of feeling left out and not important to someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsm0hf/cant_seem_to_make_close_connections_giving_up/,Eternalskiess,1,2020-04-01 06:42:38,1,/r/lonely/comments/fsm0hf/cant_seem_to_make_close_connections_giving_up/,NaN

fsngd8,Different perspective,"At least I'm working right now...

&amp;#x200B;

Just putting the positive first to satisfy the ""look at the positives"" crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for why i'm posting this in **this** specific sub reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Well. Social isolation was already occurring in my life due to the social status of someone who unfortunately has the same job as I do (A job i've been trying to get out of for the past 3 years and a job I was trying to avoid my entire life). I'm **FORCED** not to isolate myself. However I am also **FORCED** to put myself out there to catch any kind of illness that people, who choose to leave their homes for any reason, could have. Due to all of this and the current situation of the world right now my isolation from **relationships** of any kind, not including my boss, managers, or current co employees, is **FORCED** due to the fact that people in my situation are pretty prone to catching this thing. For this reason i've already made contingency plans for me **CATCHING** this thing and not avoiding it as if it were inevitable which is a really shitty way of looking at your own life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should feel more lonely than ever now but I don't. I'm actually still trying to do what I was before this quarantine took place.

&amp;#x200B;

**APPLY APPLY APPLY EVERY FUCKING DAY**

&amp;#x200B;

Its just harder now since I have even less time due to **MANDATORY RANDOM OVERTIME** which makes it even harder to work on my skillset to leave this job.....as well as the fact that majority of the jobs I actually qualify for have been eradicated.

&amp;#x200B;

So....this is to say.....

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was quarantined right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsngd8/different_perspective/,aloneabandoned,1,2020-04-01 08:00:45,0,/r/lonely/comments/fsngd8/different_perspective/,NaN
fsngfs,I don't know if I'll ever get a girlfriend.,"I'm a 21 year old guy turning 22 soon and I've never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl or had sex, etc. The crazy thing is I actually have had multiple girls like me throughout my life, not very many, but still one even asked me out when I was like 12, but I said no because it was my best friend's younger sister. Man do I regret that now. This shit tells me it's not my physical appearance so much that's holding me back although I have gotten kinda fat over the last year or two which is a problem now. The retarded thing is I've never really tried to get a girlfriend. My parents relationship soured my view of a relationship. Hearing my mom call my dad a drunk, a loser, a bum, etc. made me figure that a girlfriend would probably just look down on me like that too or look down on me like I look down on myself. I used to not care about having a girlfriend, but it's really starting to bother me now because of my age. I'm just tired of being lonely. I think low confidence and fear of rejection has also held me back when it comes to this. I've never asked a girl out or made any moves except one time on facebook during a psychosis which I regretted.

I just want to start doing everything in my power to make it possible for me to get a girlfriend starting right now.

fsny4w,I(27) would love to meet a cool woman to get to know,"Things have been pretty crazy lately! Everyone is stuck at home trying not to catch or spreed this virus and its left me to myself thinking a lot. I'm going kinda stir crazy. I can only play so much guitar, watch so many tv shows, and play so many games.

Anyways a little about me:

I don't really fit in any specific stereotype well. I'm sociable, articulate, and generally do a good job getting to know new people. Wasn't always easy for me but Ive gotten a lot better and I enjoy it a lot more now. I'm super nerdy in some ways and not in others. I like video games but also don't rage over them like many do (They are just games people, come on). I like lots of different styles of music, be it classical music or heavy metal or pop.

What I'm looking for:

So I'm looking to make a friend basically. I want to get to know someone, and be able to just be brutally open and honest from the start with each other, talk about life, the good and the bad, ect. but I want to find someone who knows how to be mature, how to have boundaries and stick to them. If I say ""hey, i'm not comfortable with that"" I expect people to respect that, and if I says something and someone isn't cool with it I expect them to tell me ""hey, you know that bothered me"" so I know. It seems insane but most people online don't seem to be able to do that.

Lastly: I'm going to be SUPER painfully blunt about this. I have some stuff in my post history, its personal, im working through it, and while I would legitimately love to find someone to talk to about that stuff with, please understand that I mean what I said about boundaries. Just because thats in my post history doesn't mean I don't want and value a genuinely good conversation that is unrelated to talking about that stuff.

Also: I'm primarly looking to (eventually) voice chat. Let talk and get to know each other a bit first but I much prefer voice chat to just texting. I have skype and discord and those are the only 2 platforms outside of reddit I'm interested in using.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsny4w/i27_would_love_to_meet_a_cool_woman_to_get_to_know/,Isolated321,1,2020-04-01 08:29:29,1,/r/lonely/comments/fsny4w/i27_would_love_to_meet_a_cool_woman_to_get_to_know/,NaN

I have an old friend who I occasionally message. Who has a habit of sounding really enthusiastic about catching up and wondering how I'm doing. But as soon as I message back. That's it. The conversation is over and the chat dies. Now I'm fine with being ghosted. But I find it odd that this person clearly cares enough to message me back with rather long response first time round. But a second message, even a half-assed one is seemingly out of the question. It's like they're trying to get my hopes up. I'd almost prefer it if I were ghosted completely. At least then I'd know where I stand with this person.

fsqcwf,For the first time in my life I've experienced REAL loneliness.,"THROWAWAY account for obvious and anonymity reason.

Well I fell in love really hard for this middle aged Turkish man that I met in at a construction site where I worked, and I was totally blown and in awe when I first made an eye contact with him. For a few seconds I couldn't take my eyes off of him because it was nothing like I had ever seen before. He had blueish grey eyes and a full beard with grey patches under both corners of his lower lip down to his chin. His hair was short, slightly curly, with a salt and pepper color. He was the most handsome man I had ever seen.I was 19 and he was 51 years old and apparently old enough to be my father but he was def my daddy tho...... Fuck me. Strangest &amp; hardest I have ever fallen for someone. Let's be real here, I am perfectly aware that it is out of  possibility. I know it's a very uncommon and unusual case, and to some extent maybe inappropriate. Fast forwards even after 5 months I'm still madly in love with him and still think about him every single day. Never the less, it doesn't make my suffering less significant just as some of you out there may feel the same way for someone. Now that the job laid off everyone because of this pandemic, I will never be able to see him again for the rest of my life. Somehow strangely relieving, yet passively painful like a chronic disease that will always find a way to latch onto you for a long time. 

Before you throw your rocks at me:

Charlie Kaufman: There was this time in high school. I was watching you out the library window. You were talking to Sarah Marsh.

Donald Kaufman: Oh, God. I was so in love with her.

Charlie Kaufman: I know. And you were flirting with her. And she was being really sweet to you.

Donald Kaufman: I remember that.

Charlie Kaufman: Then, when you walked away, she started making fun of you with Kim Canetti. And it was like they were laughing at me. You didn't know at all. You seemed so happy.

Donald Kaufman: I knew. I heard them.

Charlie Kaufman: How come you looked so happy?

Donald Kaufman: I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want.

Charlie Kaufman: But she thought you were pathetic.

Donald Kaufman: That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago.

fsr6t5,25 m looking for friendship?,"Hiya everyone! Let me just get this out of the way. I have social anxiety, so making friends is pretty difficult as I come off as socially awkward and weird.   
I guess I could tell a little about myself..
I enjoy gaming (ps4 mainly), I enjoy watching movies, but I don't really enjoy it when I watch alone because I have no one to discuss the movie with. It's the same with watching videos on youtube. I have started getting back into ERBs (if you know you know). I enjoy listening to music. My playlist is all over the place, so I basically will listen to anything. 
I am open minded. I will talk about anything. Puns. Jokes. Conspiracies. ANYTHING! (As long as you don't get offended easily) 
Here is where I believe people will be turned away. I do make tiktoks out of boredom, and yes they are cringy but tiktok itself is cringy. 

So basically if you want an open minded, lonely, socially awkward friend.. message me. I'll talk to anyone. Any age. You could be male, female, alien, or zombie, and I will still find a way to talk to you!

P.S I do have other forms of chat since the chats here can be janky.

The trouble is, every time I think about meeting new people by putting some sort of bio in a discord server for example, or finding someone with a good bio and reaching out, I just can't help but think that its gonna turn out bad. Either I and the person don't get along, which is fine because then we go our separate ways so that's actually good, or I click with someone and we talk and then I'm always the one messaging first or they never message or they are busy or they just then throw you away.

I don't understand why everybody treats meeting people as some sort of card game where they can throw away the bad ones that they don't want once they find better ones. I just wanna meet people and have friends but I'm convinced everyone is out to get me and that it will all just flop or come to an end.

fss49g,Advanced Self-Help/Improvement Topics: How to make the best out of this difficult year!,"If you like this post follow me ar [r/Crimsonpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crimsonpill/)

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

Hey guys,

We have a special post today, we are about to hit 1k, and I thought I should do something different for today, its shorter essay on how to **seize the day** even under harsh circumstances. Notice the title says, ""Advanced"" therefore if you are new to self-help and self-improvement, you **might have a hard time thinking this way**. I recommend you take precautions and try best to endure. However, for a small group of us who have *reached higher levels of understanding, we can tackle this adversity differently.*

**1- You have a strong internal locus of control**

Psychologists explain that you have an internal locus of control is when **you are in control of your life.** Meanwhile, if you have an external locus of control, you believe that anything wrong that **happens to you can be attributed to factors outside of your control.**

If you are in the former group, you can focus on the how-to best tackle the situation at hand. Get it down and then focus on how you *can make the best of the situation*. However, if you have an external locus of control, you might have a meltdown and start panicking. It's fascinating that it didn't make out any of this. Instead, I'm seeing how different groups of people are dealing with the situation at hand. While some can make the necessary precautions and focus on their goals, others letting the case break them down.

**2- During this downtime you can start valuing what matters to you**

Hopefully, by now you this situation serves as a **wake-up call** for some of you. You now know that life and time are finite, and they **can end at the drop of a hat.** If you have been living your life as a cog in the machine, you can unplug yourself and genuinely have this time to *rethink your life decisions.*

If you have been living your life scared or worried over the most mundane things like handing in homework late or arguing with your superiors, then now it's the time to stop that! **It's time for you to appreciate the life you have as a unique gift.**

**3- An Optimist sees the opportunity**

I've seen cynism taking advantage of people during these hard times. For instance, people who would use price gauging to charge others for essential items, a morally reprehensible behavior.

However, in your case, you can use this time to finally do an online job that you've wanted to do for a long time. Or to start a small online business. **Now that you see the flimsiness of life, you can begin to be daring and taking the risk** since there's nothing to fear.

**4- You can use this time to pursue your goals aggressively**

While some acquaintances of mine were panicking, those who I admired made **the most out of the situation**. For instance, this LA singer who I like started doing challenges for her fans and took this stay at home time to connect better with her fanbase. Meanwhile, a friend who is a fashion designer has taken this time off to produce more content. At this stage, he can create one video a day, which will help him exponentially grow his brand.

This experience has taught me a life lesson. While we are all going through the same situation, some of us deal with it radically different. On the one hand, we have entrepreneurs and hustlers **who find creative ways to keep on thriving.** Meanwhile, we have others who easily crumble under pressure. Now, I'm not talking about first responders who are admirable. **I'm talking about those people who find ways to make a problematic situation worst for themselves and others**.

**Conclusion**

Anyway, guys, I thought I'd share that life lesson since I see it all around. **It's undeniable. This situation is serious, and your main priority is to keep yourself and your family safe.** However, it's also essential to try and **make the best out of any bad situation we have**. It also invites us to **a broader reflection**. Sometimes some of you ask me, ""If my parents were rich, my life would have been different"" or ""If the people at my high school were good, I would have had an incredible social life."" How can we see that different groups of people are dealing with the same cards, yet some see it as a catastrophe others see its ways to overcome it?

Some questions to reflect on:

fssb3u,Being lonely for so so so long. (RANT),"After 4-5 years of being pretty much trapped in my own thoughts and nothing else it really does destroy you. Sometimes you can deal with it and then the next minute you're sad as shit with no hope. It's just all I'd need is a hug or something, ya know? Social Anxiety has well and truly destroyed me as a person and has taken my life. Any enjoyment I used to have has been taken from me and It's just so sad because I know there's so much to enjoy in life but, I can't go and get it because of my mental issue. You try and get help but all they do is diagnose you and drug you. I'm tired of living like this, I'm tired of living in a cell, locked by my own thoughts and feelings. It's made me a terrible person and such a mean and dark soul but, behind that I'm such a soft guy but, after not having love and just someone to lean back onto the feeling of love becomes completely alien to you. I don't even know what it's like to be truly loved, that feeling of LOVE is something I've never been able to experience because, I have been trapped in my house for the past 4-5 years and I'm only 16. I'm not even able to enjoy doing things that normal teenagers do and I've forced myself to grow up and it makes you wanna just end it. I love everyone deep down but, my issues just make me seem like I wanna be an aggressive little asshole. People who are upset and vent out at people calling them the worst things and trying to make them sad is pure projection and it's a way of earning attention. When you're so lonely for so long and you become deprived of just a hug or a hello it turns you into a sour person and you'll do anything to get a bit of attention. Sometimes you do wanna just fly above the sky and break free you know what I mean? Sometimes life is a bitch but, there's life being a bitch and then there's life being a stone cold bitch for years on end. I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy. It's hard to even sleep at times because you know that when you wake up it's just the same cycle. You wake up, do nothing for most of the day and then sleep. But, I don't want that, I wanna escape, go to a mountain and just scream because I've piled everything on top of each other for AGES and after a while you can only hold so much before it bursts out. I know that people become lonely after a break-up but, I can't relate at all as I said before I've never even felt love, I've definitely liked a girl but never got anywhere with it. I don't even know why I got this fucked up disorder it seems like something just switched inside me and I was destined to be lonely for life, I honestly might as well be locked up on death row. Sorry for the long post, but I could write forever. Thank you if you read the entire thing I wish you the best in life.

fssdld,Left alone after a little relationship 20m,"Hey, these last few weeks for me have been a rollercoaster of emotions for me. I’ve always been a ‘lone-wolf’ and the most I would be with people is just as “acquaintances”. All throughout HS I’ve been fairly alone, towards the end of senior year I made a really good female friend. Enjoyed her company a lot but never really was sexually attracted to her, relationship went down the gutter after HS. 
Anyways, the reason I come on here is just to vent a little...as I said these past few weeks has been wild. After almost two years of being out of highschool and not really connecting with people in a Deeper level I somehow managed to find a highly sexual “friend” through work. We lasted roughly 1 month,  our relationship went like this 
We would act as a couple, cuddle, go out and buy stuff together, go out and eat together, do the nasty (the first person I did it with) ect. 
However she would say that “I am not looking for a relationship rn”
Everything was great, she made it seem like she was madly in love with me with all the comments she would make at me. It’s been a really long time since I’ve had someone to just talk to without having my guard up, and it was a great feeling. But all that ended really quick two weeks ago, we met up for what I didn’t know was the last time. We did our thing and for the next week and a half she would go MIA on me. Whenever I would ask hey what’s up, or just simply trynna talk to her, she would send one dry ass text and ignore me for a couple of more days.

At first I was upset, I thought i was devastated cause I miss her. But after she told me what was going on (roughly 4 days ago she admitted to me that she found someone else that she liked a lot)
I felt a lot of closure and my mind cleared up....I started realizing I just miss the feeling of having someone to talk to on a daily basis and just talk about small things that happen in my life. It was a great feeling to have at the time, now I just feel very lonely having no one to talk to .

I'm afraid of spiraling down to a state of utter desperation and depression if I have to meet certain people again.

And now I’ve found out that the last friend I had that didn’t have children is pregnant with her first. I’m happy for her and all my other friends that are pregnant/have kids/just got engaged, but I want it for myself SO badly.

I want to fall in love with someone who loves me and have babies. I don’t think it’s asking for much, but I’m 25, and it feels like time is slipping away so quickly. With the quarantine, I’m never going to find my person.

I have re written this post a hundred times and it never sounds right , “I am lonely” , there is just so much cognitive dissonance since at any moment people are just a press of a button away; but there is something missing that I just don’t know what it is and it weighs so heavy on my mind and it crushes my chest and it’s as though I am deep underwater with pressure around me at all times until I finally fall asleep or distract myself 

And at the same time I know exactly what it is that is missing but I’m not sure I’m going to be able to attain it and that’s what really scares me.

At this point honestly I’m not sure why I am writing this since *maybe* 5 or 6 people *might* read it but I really don’t care. I just hope that of those 5, 1 relates enough to feel less alone in their loneliness.

Okay if you're reading this, thank you, I need to get my feelings out. When I started high-school I was falling ill with an eating disorder. This is important because at the time I had extreme anxiety, which made me isolate myself from everyone, even my closest friends. In my second year of HS I got hospitalised for my eating disorder and I missed a year of school. This year I have returned and I'm a different person. I'm the old me. (the old me is a bubbly and fun person and when I was in primary school I was fairly popular (not in a gross way I just had lots of friends)) And I really, really want to people to like me but I have been labeled as a 'weird kid' meaning that no one wants to be my friend so I am being excluded and in some cases bullied (which has been emotionally draining as everyone chooses the other side over me) I've tried everything to make myself more likeable, going as far as to join a high intensity and high commitment sport in an effort to make connections, and it hasn't worked. (I'm literally crying writing this lmao).

Does anyone else feel this way?? I feel so alone and I really want to fall back on my eating disorder to cope but I know that is a terrible idea as it's what got me here in the first place and it was just as bad (worse tbh) having anorexia.

You have nice eyebrows and I don’t fill in my brows. I could but I like to look more natural.

I use Instagram but mainly to keep in touch with my friends abroad.

You wrote you’re not typical, I can accept you.

You look honest, that’s why I like you . I want to get to know you and count on you.

I am new to this country and I’m very lonely, I know no one. Eventually you’ll see, I’ll do anything for you. If you want I’ll send you my passport and address so you know I am who I say I am. I have nothing to hide.

My friends say you’ll like me because I’m sweet and pretty,

I am sweet and shy but I’ll be open with you.

I have been through a lot for my age. So I can empathise with more serious issues as well as just laugh about more light-hearted things.  
  
I know a lot of people here on Reddit play video games, and they can be a great distraction. So I’ll mention that I have a PlayStation if you’d like someone to play with too, or maybe we can pass some songs back and forth.  
  
Whatever is going on, just know that I’m here, and whether it’s today or tomorrow, or next week, you can send me a message if you’re struggling and having someone to talk to would help. With the quarantine active I doubt I’ll be going anywhere anytime soon.  
  
And otherwise, I hope you have a wonderful evening, or night, or day, and are staying safe during this time.  
  
I look forward to chatting soon. 😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsy8pb/im_nonjudgemental_and_a_good_listener_here_if_you/,celestial_nobody,1,2020-04-01 20:46:04,0,/r/lonely/comments/fsy8pb/im_nonjudgemental_and_a_good_listener_here_if_you/,NaN
fsygbt,Disabled and lonely,I have been dealing with my loneliness for quite some time now. I feel like everyone who’s around me is around me because I’m a good person. But that the only reason. I don’t know if that’s bad or not. Everything else I get into nobody ends up wanting to do. From the music I listen to to the games I get nobody really wants to join me.I try making new friends but just talking to new people is hard for me. No matter if it’s online or not. With my Asperger’s and narcolepsy it makes everything really difficult to even function day to day.I wish I could fine someone may be a girl who be interested in the same thing I am would spend time with me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsygbt/disabled_and_lonely/,mackeym10,1,2020-04-01 21:01:47,10,/r/lonely/comments/fsygbt/disabled_and_lonely/,NaN

fsyov6,"20 M, Sometimes I feel like sacrificing my own life to save thousands of people suffering because I can't see people in pain and helping them makes me happy.","So I'm 20, I've been hurt mentally and physically so much that I have become too numb to feel pain anymore. Lately though there were instances where someone asked me to break my guard off and let off emotions to ease pain but it only increased pain and made me cry and hurt more. I've always agreed to the fact crying and feeling pain makes a man weaker and when i don't feel ot anymore it doesn't hurt. 

I'm just too alone in life with nobody to cry after me if I die which even my own abusive mother says which is quite true but I wanna be a superhero in real life more like a crime fighter though with no powers I wanna use my life to save a lot of people. I've also been betrayed a lot of times, met selfish people and yeah the world has a lot of selfish people but I wanna be a selfless man.

You know there are times after college, the money my mom gives to me at times to come back home after college, I donate it to the poor and needy on the streets to see them smile thinking this will get them through, most often I even end up donating my entire pocket money for a whole month for a good cause because I can't see people in pain being someone who has been in pain a lot in life I can just imagine what worse than me they could be suffering.

I don't go to work even when at times I feel like i should work for earning money but mom doesn't let me work but even if I somehow will, I'm sure she will take my whole money because she's a crazy lady as she has threatened me to who has always hurt me and abused me over the years and never liked me being happy or becoming successful in life even breaking my Electronic gadgets at times or making me go through extreme tortures by beating me or getting people to hurt me despite of me being her own child she treats me badly even starving me at times. Though the torture has increased over the years my emotionless self has developed resistance towards every harm she does to me as I look at the sky always and believe that next year when I'll be eventually escaping and moving out, I'll save thousands of children suffering and also adopt kids who don't have parents and raise them as my own giving them all the happiness of their life that they wouldn't have gotten had they lived in orphanages or foster homes and treated the same way my own mother treated me and I wouldn't want that to happen for them and give them the best happiest life with all the happiness and no pain or atleast get them to safer homes.

I still have a year to finish college and leave this abusive place but even after I leave the home I wonder what kind of life will i live. I wanna be a superhero to fight crime because that makes me happy. I wanna being justice to the poor, expose the corrupt people and even if I die fighting for a good cause I'll still have no regrets because atleast I'll be putting my life to use for a good cause.

That's true people have not liked me over the years, nobody, also because of the way I look like which i have come to accept too that yeah I don't look like those good looking guys. So yeah even my love life is dry for which I don't have any regrets too as I have a lot of time and I wanna put my empty life to good use as well as yeah after I die nobody will cry for me that's great but me giving a lot of people who deserve a lot of happiness in their life who have the people they love with them, struggle with corrupted people or struggle with poverty etc will make me happy because atleast they have someone to live for but I have my own self to live for and What will I take to my grave after I die? No matter how rich I become I will only carry my body to the grave that's it while the worldly wealth wouldn't be of any use. 

I'm a spiritual guy and I wanna do good for the world as much as I can. I'm not a superhero, not a devil, not an angel but an ordinary guy who wants to be a secret crimefighter and social worker to do good to bring peace in this world.

You know one fine day when I'll die on the battlefield or on my bed I'll still smile knowing that I fought for the truth and what's right and layed my life down to save a lot of lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fsyov6/20_m_sometimes_i_feel_like_sacrificing_my_own/,Zackpattrick,1,2020-04-01 21:18:15,3,/r/lonely/comments/fsyov6/20_m_sometimes_i_feel_like_sacrificing_my_own/,NaN
fsyzl4,33 M Irish ☘️ - Isolation buddies?,"Hi,
I’m still in self isolation and the loneliness really does set in, the worst part is not knowing the end date so nothing can be planned. 
The news where I live is predicting that the next two weeks will be the peak which will maybe be followed by another peak a few weeks later. 
Needless to say this is causing some anxiety. 

I would enjoy having some new women to talk to during this time. 

If you have been self isolating too, how have you been coping?

How are things where you live now?

ft1kn2,"Loneliness is shield, like a Chrysalis to a caterpillar.","I found out that loneliness is actually good for some of us, cause no one can hurt you, cause there is no one.
It's like chrysalis for a caterpillar going under metamorphosis, we need it, if we don't have it, we will get eaten by predators or something else, it's crucial for our survival.
For me atleast, I just have to be in my chrysalis until death frees me so I can fly free as a butterfly in the end. All I have to is, don't leave it, don't let other enter it, and so there'll be no new pain until death does me part. I'll be okay by myself, I still have few pieces of myself left with me, it's not worth it to gamble it all away. And people don't understand it, that's why they tell you to not do it, cause maybe they're birds or flies or some predators who doesn't understand the need to or they just wanna have a claw at you and when it goes wrong, they'll just stand there and say, how would I have known while you suffer. 
It's not for everyone, I'm not telling everyone to be lonely, I know not everyone is a caterpillar who had enough, some of you are different and have a different path. I'm just sharing what's mine.
It's not all dark and gloomy once I realised this. This is actually good for me. That's all I had to share, for some you who wanna be alone but struggling with it, here's a thought to exercise so it's easier to convince and strengthen yourself. Be like metapod my fellow caterpillars, your time and situation to be a butterfly might be different than mine and fly free in the clear sky while being alive.

ft3jiz,I want to feel happy on my own,"Hey guys,

Maybe a little background story about me first. I’ve been a lonewolf pretty much all my life. Between the ages of 13-24, I kept losing myself in games, books and shows. I’ve been depressed since I was 12, because I came out to my Turkish parents as lesbian. They didn’t take it well. Because of that event my course of my life has changed for the worse. I kept searching for love in other people, so desperately, that I keep losing myself in another person that I don’t see the purpose in life anymore after the person has left. I keep going in circles. 

Last month, I finally decided to look for professional help again after my 27th birthday, because I keep self-sabotaging myself whenever I feel lonely, whether it be school, or anything else I was vert passionate about. The last time (and first) time I looked for help I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder. It all made sense. 

But the reason I’m reaching out to the internet is because, all appointments with my psychiatrist are cancelled until corona measurements have ended. And I have never, ever felt this lonely, awful and depressed in my entire life. Maybe because we aren’t quarantained by choice this time. I don’t know. I’m tired and I just lost a person during quarantaine that was really dear to me and she hasn’t given me any closure, which is fine. Because I’m done having my own feelings controlled by another person. It’s just that I’m afraid I’ll never be able to know how to be happy on my own because it’s been so long. 

I don’t know. Thank you for reading, guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ft3jiz/i_want_to_feel_happy_on_my_own/,Goorillamanorrr,1,2020-04-02 01:56:01,5,/r/lonely/comments/ft3jiz/i_want_to_feel_happy_on_my_own/,NaN
ft3m36,I am alone,"I just dont feel like anyone understands me. My parents, too old to understand my problems. My 3 siblings who are all 10+ years older than me, well, they have their own life. It doesnt help when im clearly an accident. My family doesnt really communicate a lot. Even if my family had a groupchat, you should see how empty it'd be. It's been long since my family had gone out together. My family is struggling financially now and its caused by how poor they handle their money. I was too young to understand but I know now. I worked a minimum wage job for the past few months trying to buy school necessities. My school laptop especially. Financially burdened to the point my parents borrowed from me 3k$. 
Family a side. My social life outside of my family doesnt help either. I have anxiety and im socially awkward so it suits me to be an introvert. Its really hard for me to make friends. I would ever say I only had 1 friend in primary school that I could talk to. I would always stick with him during lunch break even after we split class. I still contact him. He's my definition of a friend. Though, he doesnt understand me much, he is a great friend. 
In secondary school, things were different. I was more confident than I was in primary school. Puberty, I guess. I made much more ""friends"". Reason why I used quotation marks was because they barely understood me. I always felt left out. During sports class I would always get picked last even though I wouldnt say im physically unfit.
Apart from that. Me being socially awkward with girls really doesnt help. I can barely talk to girls without messing up. I just feel useless and helpless. Needless to say, I think some of them might think im gay just because I dont talk to them. 
And how did I cope with this? I masturbate a few times a day. And it's not something im proud of. I feel like the only thing that is keeping me alive and happy is doing this... I just feel happy that im able to fulfill my sexual desires online... really happy. Nothing can make me this happy really. I dont talk to anyone. I wake up, masturbate, shower, eat, play on my phone and sleep. It doesnt help when school hasnt started yet. 
After doing it many times, I mustve realised what im doing is wrong right? Its not like im locked up in my house not able to go out? Apparently my country isnt on lockdown yet so no. At this point, im addicted, I dont know if I should be thankful for my addiction. If I didnt have access, I think I would have been dead from loneliness long ago. I just feel so happy even when I know im lonely that im able to watch all this things. Words really cant describe how happy I get when I do it. Its pathetic but its what keeps me sane and happy. I look forward to it everyday. Ive wasted 100s of dollar for this. Its unhealthy which is why Ive even tried r/nofap but that is obviously not gonna help.
I doubt anyone reads this but I just wanted to vent out. I cant even talk to anyone about my situation. Its pathetic and ridiculous. They would just say that I should ""talk more"" ""be more confident"". I cant even before I started doing it.

ft8e2g,My walls and rules.,"I don't know how to begin this. Sorry if all of this makes no sense but I'm only writing what crosses my mind.

I have really big anxiety. I can't build any trust and because of that I feel really lonely. I'm really introverted and don't really like it when I'm around people a long time. But with this whole situation with covid-19 I'm lonelier than ever. I just ended my friendship with my best friend because she was only using my and it damaged my trust in people even more. I have the feeling that nobody wants anything to do with me. Everyone is avoiding me because I radiate this dark feelings. 
I usually don't tell people what's wrong with me because in my head a voice always says: ""telling anyone what's wrong will result in more pain"". I created this rules and walls over the past 12 years. Everytime someone hurt me a sertain way I created a rule that this wouldn't happen again. 12 years ago my father died. I'm in such great fear of forgetting him that I keep as much as possible what my father owned. 
I'm trying to keep myself distracted as much as possible. The only way that works is with Netflix or YouTube. I pretend to be a part of whatever I'm watching... 
Today was a very bad day for me. I didn't get accepted into my dream job. I'm standing here and I'm looking into this dark future. I don't know what I want to do when I finish school. Every friend of mine has a plan, is happy and I living their life like they don't see the bad parts. I only see the bad parts... I only see the worst case scenario in everything. 
When I have no energy to do anything I usually withdraw myself from everyone and everything. This is another rule I set for myself. ""Don't do something when you got no energy. You could make a mistake and reveal to much of you"".
Not even my closed friends know everything about me. Not even my family knows my struggle. 
I don't like it when rules get broken. Especially my rules. Rules are there to protect and define something... 
My rules and walls define me. 

Nobody wants to bring up that energy to try to break the walls I build around me because nobody could even like someone they don't know that much to even try. I'm basically to scared to show someone my real me because that would make me vulnerable. 

That's it. That's everything that crossed my mind in the last 2 weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ft8e2g/my_walls_and_rules/,82664828,1,2020-04-02 05:52:10,0,/r/lonely/comments/ft8e2g/my_walls_and_rules/,NaN

I have been a loner all my life and despite being kinda comfortable with it, there isn't a week that doesn't have a single night, when I do not suddenly overcome with loneliness, longing for friendship and romantic companionship.

So what do I do to rectify my loneliness? Absolutely nothing.

""Oh gee, I could start playing that MMORPG, I would definietly meet some new online buddies there"" aaaaaand I proceed to play said MMO for 400 hours as a solo player, only ever meeting other people when I am forced to due to pvp/raiding

I get, that I have a hermit personality type, but then why am I still getting these mood swings, when I suddenly become so incredibly lonely, but by the next morning I want nothing to do with anyone? Heck, here I am writing on r/lonely in one of my lonely mood, when I know from past experience, that even if someone starts talking to me and we have a conversation, I will most likely completely abandon the discussion come tomorrow, when I suddenly get back into my hermit self, until a week later the lonelyness hits again.

fta9wr,A (very?) weird life story,"I've studied in 10 schools. Lived in 20 houses, divided among 4 different cities, one of them in a different state altogether. 

I'm a 22 years old woman.

My family is not close. My father has another family now and just doesn't have the time anymore. My mother was a monster to us and even the thought of aproaching her is usually enough for me to get afraid for myself. My older younger sister (does this work in English?...) lives in another city, we see each other once a year and rarely talk. My younger younger sister still lives with my mother in even ANOTHER city that I am still to visit. My younger brother is five and lives with my father in the city I was born.

I have one long time friend. We've known each other for 9 years. The last time we saw each other was in... idk 2016? But we sometimes talk through the web. I also have another two friends who are not that close but whom I've known for also 9 and 8 years. I almost never talk to them. These are the ones who know me for the most time.

I learned very early in life that friendships last little time, vanish fast and are replaced even faster and that never really bothered me. I used to change my persona each new school, for example, just because. I was not afraid to change houses or schools, and never really felt sad for leaving everyone I knew in those places. I would never really talk about me because it didn't matter, everybody was going to go away, as they did.

In spite of that, I didn't like to be alone. I always looked for someone who seemed like would like me and that would be my best friend for the next one or two years until I moved again. I rarely really liked them. I would be what I needed to be so I wasn't alone. Sometimes, it was a relief to change best friends, because I just couldn't take them. Also, I never made any efforts to keep in touch with those friends, as seemed natural for me.

Now I'm an adult. I've lived by myself for five years now and moved six times since then. I'm in college, and the UNTHINKABLE has happened. I made very good, fantastic, absolutely indiscrabable, precious friends who think like me, know me as nobody would EVER know when I was a kid and STILL, still like me for who I am. I just can't tell you guys how that feels. It's just like I died and am in heaven, or like God had mercy of me for once and gave me some angel friends for a while... yes, for a while... they are already fading out...

College is almost over. They are going back to their cities. We are not gonna talk. And I feel like I'm about to lose the most precious gifts I've ever earned, my treasures. I'm preparing to be all alone again, and that feels like I'm just getting ready to take my heart out and throw it in a shredder.

I know that's what's going to happen. I won't ask you to teach me how you guys keep long time friendships, because I think I know what I should do, I just... can't. Because I never did and it is extremely hard.

I just felt like sharing this.

I don't have anyone to hear. I don't want to look needy. I just love them so much. I feels so weird to care this much. I just wish things could be different.

No one's fault except I was interested in taking the risk and I think she was still in love with her ex. Point is I saw what I'm missing out on being with other people: friends and relationships.

I have a best friend I’ve known since high school and when things get hard she completely ghosts me. She will read my messages and ignore me until a much much later date once everything passes.

For example when my grandma died she did this. She is also doing it out during coronavirus.

I am always there for her, for whatever she needs. I just don’t get it back and it really hurts me.

It makes me feel like I’m annoying or needy and that I shouldn’t ever confide in friends.

I’m really torn up about it and I don’t know what to do. I have even tried to talk to her about it and she always says she is busy replying to emails(she doesn’t work at all so it is definitely a lie)

I know I’m not a crazy person who has an episode every time something bad happens, but I don’t really have uh family to speak for.

ftcy78,i dont know where else to go so i chose here,"i grew up with really bad trust issues. my father was never in my life. like he lived with me for 8 years but i just.. never connected with him. he was a drugatic and abusive to my mother and i. he told me he loved me and i believed him, until i found out he just doesnt love me. he never called me, he never texted me. 

i went into a cycle that i think he wants to be in my life and he promises to call me tomorrow and he never does, then i bawl up all my emotions and go into a really bad meltdown. at some point i decided he just doesnt care about me and if he does then he wouldve remembered those 100 times he promised to call me back or text me back. since then i just havent been able to connect with people the way i want to. i cant trust them with my feelings, i cant trust them with my thoughts- anything. 

because of my father i have ptsd. i cant sleep, loud noises make me go into an anxiety attack, all of the above. because of my ptsd i lash out, ive never used it as an excuse til this moment. i apologize right after because i realize my mistakes and sincerely didnt mean it. my girlfriend thinks i want to break up with her because i have trouble trusting her. in my mind i have every right to not trust her. shes gone behind my back multiple times to smoke when i told her if she continues smoking i will break up with her when shes promised me countless times shell stop. i dont believe her when she tells me she loves me and im scared to tell my thoughts in fear shell laugh and tell me theyre stupid.

i feel so by myself. she says that i can trust her, that she trust me so why cant i do the same with her. she says she tells me everything so i should do the same. my mother isnt any help with my problems with loneliness. instead of finding the source shell find alternative ways to fix the problem. shell go onto facebook groups and say that i like need to get out the house or smth. she says my problems are in my head and if i wanted  to get rid of the thoughts i just do it, she said im not working hard enough to fix them.

In the last nights I've been sitting awake fantasizing how it would be to hang out with people I know and make casual conversation inside my mind (you know, the usual). But I've noticed today that I don't feel negative emotions while it's happening, like no sadness, frustration, I don't feel like it's bothering me as much as it used to. But the fact is that I spent have the night thinking about it, so even if my conscious won't admit it I can tell that in my subconscious I really need human contact. 

I'm also in coreantin which doesn't help.

I'm just afraid tbh. For a while now I had trouble connecting to the people around me, and I guess it will get better but the feeling of powerlessnes is so fucking anointing, that for this time, there is nothing I can do  to help myself.

ftenfj,I want to be in a relationship so badly,"I want to be in a relationship so badly. The first problem is finding someone. Thankfully that isnt much of a problem. This is where the main problems start to happen

Problem 1) almost as soon as i get into a relationship I loose that crush feeling that made me like them in the first place. 

Problem 2) I have no idea what it means to be a boyfriend, as in responsibilities. I'll happily do anything that she tells me to do, and ill really try my best, but im just clueless

Problem 3) Im terrible at opening up. Not just in a relationship but in general. Im more of a quiet guy,  ill joke around and with my friends i could be loud but in terms of actually opening up and expressing my feelings is just something i feel that im incapable of doing, and honestly it scares me

Problem 4) im too insecure. Every text i send takes me longer to press send then it does to write the text itself. And saying things like i love you terrifies me. For somereason it sounds weird to me and i want to get over that but idk how. Its not that i don't have feelings for them, i do, but im just terrified of sayings things like that and even as far as complementing them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ftenfj/i_want_to_be_in_a_relationship_so_badly/,isthiswhatavibeis,1,2020-04-02 12:00:54,2,/r/lonely/comments/ftenfj/i_want_to_be_in_a_relationship_so_badly/,NaN
ftexal,I wish you were still in my life Callie,"I wish things hadn't ended how they did, I should have stuck around and tried harder to work through it with you. I was so caught up in my own pain that I wasn't seeing yours. I should have tried to find that middle ground where we could meet and come together. Instead I broke us apart. I wish you'd have been able to see the pain I was going through for so long, but you just brushed it aside. Maybe it was my fault for not expressing it properly, but in the end I felt you were gaslighting me and at the time that was just too much for me. I wish rather than ending our friendship, we'd have agreed to take a break for a month and come back with cooler heads. But things were just so built up all I could see was pain. I couldn't stand the idea of having my feelings belittled any longer, and enduring what had become toxic behaviour. I just wish I was smart enough to say what I was thinking and feeling in a way you could have understood. I didn't hate you, and I didn't mean I was innocent in everything, I just wish you could have seen your own toxic behaviours. We could have worked on our faults together. We could have made each other better people. If only we'd have listed to each other, and if only I hadn't ended it. I wish we'd have been able to heal each others pain rather than run from it. 
I really miss you Callie. My life just isn't the same without you. Only those last few months were bad. I wish we could have worked it out. 
I hope you still have the earings I made you, the love I wrote inside them still holds true. I still have the pen you sent me, and I use the toothbrush every day thinking about you. 
I don't think you'll ever see this. But I still love you. And I think I always will. 
Always yours.

ftf065,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music","Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

When I walk outside my house, people everywhere walking people everywhere on the bus, unyet no communication.

ftf5ch,I feel so alone,"I have Aspergers, depression, anxiety and a few other weird disorders that means I’m both dependent on social contact and I’m also super self conscious about that contact. A little over a year ago I came out to myself as trans, and now that I’m trapped in my house I’ve been feeling more alone than ever. I’m trapped with my dad at the moment, and we have had a good relationship. My family is mostly pretty conservative, but my dad had always taught me empathy and to respect others. My grandparents hate him for it, but I always respected the fact that he went out of his way to try and keep me away from the more judgmental kinda mindsets my more conservative relatives believe. Anyways, he caught me in a skirt the other day and I took the opportunity to come out to him.

I had thought if anyone in my family would take it well, or understand it would be my dad. However, he sat me down and told me how I can’t know and that I’m just a gay guy probably into cross dressing. I know a lot of people are rejected way worse, but I think it’s okay for me to feel a little hurt. My dad was the one I thought would’ve gotten it, and I wanted his support, but now he’s been distant. It’s not like he’s being an asshole, but he’s been avoiding me. 

I have a small group of friends I’m close with including one I’m super close with. I love him to death, just a wonderful friend who I think the world of, but he’s also gotten distant. Maybe he’s annoyed cause I’ve gotten needy, but whatever it is I don’t blame him. I can’t help but notice however how he’ll talk to people on group chats for hours and respond at the first mention of his name, but just take forever to respond to me. I know it’s selfish, he doesn’t owe me his time, I guess it just elevates my existing loneliness.  It’s not his fault, I shouldn’t be putting my need for contact onto him, but it’s one of those things I know abstractly but haven’t internalized. It’s not his fault, I just feel like everyone else is handling quarantine better than me and no one else has the energy to deal with my bullshit.

I guess the reason I wanted to type this out is just to have this written out. My dad has been super passive aggressive with me, but he also refuses to reference the problem between us. I can’t deal with him, because when I do I just get angry cause he was supposed to be the person who understood. Then I just feel everyone else is handling it better than me and they don’t have the time to be there and so I feel so alone. It’s not my friends fault, but I don’t think I’m a bad person for wishing I had someone who could be there to talk to.

ftggod,Surrounded by friends virtually and still lonely.,"I’m very used to social distancing due to my introvertedness and the fact my last relationship was long distance and I used FaceTime to talk to him everyday. Lately, I’ve been feeling extra lonely, stuck on the house, but at the same time, I don’t even care to talk to my friends I could FaceTime because I’ve been so depressed and down and don’t wanna share this side of me. This sucks. I feel so alone cause honestly, I’m don’t care to talk to my friends all I want is talk to the guy Ive been talking and hanging out with, but he’s be ghosting me all of a sudden and making me feel extra down.

This one time me and this girl were getting along really well, we would text back and forth for hours on end for weeks.

And I freeze we stared at each other for like 3 minutes until eventually said I had to go to the bathroom and ran for the hills like a little bitch. She leaves shortly after and basically never talk again.

ftid6q,Anyone with the same interests as me? Knows there’s someone but can’t really find anyone,"                 Hello, I’m a teen and a diagnosed Schizotypal (although I’m really good socially when talking to people one-on-one.) Not seen as much of a “weirdo,” as I’m not socially inept. I’m really into the old internet; I love AMVs, 4chan, nostalgic stuff in general. My favorite movie is American Psycho, and I really like YouTube channels like ScareTheater and Nexpo. Into gore/guro and those dumb scary web games like Slendytubbies, Slender, etc. Been on BestGore a couple times, although I’m usually really empathetic towards those in pain. I can handle gore, but not stuff like that. 

         I really want to watch the lost anime Saki Sanobashi, I play Don’t Starve Together, and I enjoy ARGs as well. I really really love flash games! Newgrounds especially. I used to play all the old JMKit games, do you guys remember those? It really feels like I’m back in 2010.

People try to be my friend and I push them away because I feel uncomfortable and I don't know why I'm like this. I just wish I could stop existing. I don't want to die, but I just wish everything would stop. I hate feeling apathetic all the time. I hate feeling alone but once someone actually wants to accompany me I reject it. I hate this. I don't want to talk about what happened. I don't care anymore. Can some other lonely people just tell me what you do to pass the time non-lonely people are using to go hang out with their friends?

ftj5rd,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I’m so desperate for love and human contact right now. And no, this isn’t just because of the coronavirus, though I suppose that may have amplified it a little bit.

For context when I refer to “love” I don’t specifically mean romantic love. I mean all kinds.

I don’t think I have ever truly felt love towards anybody, not even my family, even though they’re good people. I’ve had many friends but I don’t think I ever loved them. Everything positive I’ve ever felt towards the people I surround myself with feels more like an appreciation for things they’ve done for me, or just in general thinking they are a fun person.

I’ve also struggled with depression for a long time and finally got on some medication for it at the very beginning of the year. It has helped with my general sense of self. Basically I don’t hate myself anymore. Or at least it doesn’t feel like I do.

However, being able to spend less time focusing on myself has heightened my awareness of just how fucking lonely I am. I’m incredibly touch starved and just overall I feel like I have nobody to talk to about anything.

But here’s the issue. It’s not like I’ve never, ever had that someone to talk to in my life. I have, a couple of times. But every single person that has been there for me emotionally I have pushed away. I start to resent them for trying to help me, even to the point of hating them, even though they literally have done nothing wrong and have actually been there for me. This has happened with my mother and former best friend.

The most recent experience I had with this was a friend I made during the first semester of my college year. She was basically my only friend until I later found another group to hang out with. I ended up introducing her to that group and we all hung out together. Her and I got really close though, and the closer we got, the more I started to hate her. It got to the point where I would flat out ignore her and give her dirty looks. I think I really hurt her feelings, considering that she later admitted she had a crush on me. Somewhere in the back of my mind I think I could tell and that’s why I pushed her away. We’ve talked about it and have resolved the conflict, but we don’t even talk anymore and things will never be the same between us.

I just don’t know why this happens to me. I want to be loved and to love so bad, but every time I see it coming I start to freak out. It’s 100% the reason why I’ve never kissed anyone or been in a relationship. Because everybody knows I don’t want it. But somehow I still do.

It’s been like this for a long time. When I was 13-14-15 I told everyone I was asexual even though I really wasn’t simply because I didn’t want anybody trying to flirt with me or get with me. And it worked. I later admitted to myself that I was just in denial of my true sexuality and needed to stop being so afraid.

But I’m still afraid. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why I’m so scared of love. I don’t even have any trauma I could draw from that would explain this. Does anybody here feel the same or have any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ftj5rd/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,ccwandco,1,2020-04-02 18:12:09,0,/r/lonely/comments/ftj5rd/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,NaN

ftj9zo,Never Been Kissed,"I'm a girl who has been consciously saving her first kiss.

I've been saving myself all this time because I believed that somehow, somewhere, there was someone out there doing the same for me. Someone with an ideal they were willing to demonstrably strive for; a part of themselves they held-firm for that one special person. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of alternative, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.

Yet, there are days in which I reminisce what ""friends"" would tell me. With their judgemental looks plastered on their faces and stories of fun times they've had with their partners, I can't help but feel so...*alone*. Naturally, my constant moving has made me miss out on any romantic possibility, and I often wonder--would I really end up meeting the one? 

I'm just here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me or others who might feel the same way I do. Despite what seems to be popular today and despite what the rest of the world is doing--despite what society may deem as normal, and despite what people may try to convince you of otherwise, I'm rooting for those who're following their beliefs.

ftntco,Make sure you don’t bypass red flags,"Buckle in this is going to be a long ride, or skip to the tldr hehe

I’m not sure where to start. I was best friends with someone for a few years, we’ll call Doot. Yes, Doot. Things started off rough early on, Doot would send me unsolicited nsfw pics and links of nsfw stuff and it made me really uncomfortable, red flag, I know. For this, I stopped all contact with him for several months, which he as confused about. Yes, I basically ghosted him. I no longer ghost people as I’m a much better communicator, but when I’m being mistreated in a sexual way, I kinda clam up due to past sexual traumas... which I didn’t understand at the time... and I know now why I ghosted him. Anyways, we talked about it later on and he apologized for it. We’re all good now, so I thought. 

*The good times*

Time goes on and at this point I’m in a relationship, Doot is a normal friend and our friendship is great. We help each other through a number of issues and enjoy talking about topics like Chinese history, YouTube drama, shows, mental health, etc. We’d talk (voice chat) almost daily and usually for hours at a time. 

My toxic relationship is finally over. What a great feat I had overcome, Doot helped me through a lot of this. I felt I finally had a “best best friend.” 

Eventually Doot realized he had feelings for me, which I didn’t share for him. He told me it wouldn’t change our friendship and that because we had should a great friendship he would be much worse off without me. I was glad we had each other still. I’d always refer to doot as “my best friend ____” every time I mentioned him to anyone. I made sure everyone knew he was my #1, and no other friend was before him. 

*Shit hits the fan*

But then everything changed when I I became ready to meet someone new and it wasn’t him... problems started to arise. Doot was resentful of me for not being into him, he would even tell me “I know you’re in love with me deep down and you want to be with me.” Which I would politely and carefully try to refuse. 

He even mentioned once that if he kept saying it eventually I would believe it and laughed after... I’m starting to think he was trying to manipulate my feelings then. It makes me sick to my stomach if he really was going for that. 

Doot would tell me I’m “immature,” and “don’t understand” how I feel. He’d tell me I’m autistic, even after I told him multiple times he doesn’t have the authority to say that. But unfortunately, It got me believing that maybe he’s right, maybe I don’t get how I feel. 

He’d tell me I would regret not being with him later on, he’d tell me my taste in men was “weird” and everyone I thought was attractive was “ugly,” 99% of the time. 

During all this he was making inappropriate comments about me constantly, even while on speaker and when my mom was around. At first I would just pretend like I didn’t hear, or I’d try to change the subject, and often say “okay stop.” But he would just laugh it off and say “I love how uncomfortable you get.” This is heartbreaking thinking about it now. Doot knew about my past sexual abuse traumas and still did all of this. Eventually, I jokingly would say “okay I’m gonna kill you,” and then later and more frequently I’d just say “OKAY STOP.” Everyday he’d make some sexual comment about me, multiple times a day and it made me feel sad/weird/angry/resentful. 

*The excuses*

When id confront him on this he’d give me some excuse about how he’s British and since I’m American I’m just a prude and that I need to lighten up. 

He’d also use his friendship with another person we’ll call beep to justify his behaviors. According to doot, beep was all for doots “jokes.” Although they weren’t nearly as bad towards her because she was in a relationship and he didn’t have feelings for her. Completely different situation imo. 

Another excuse: Him having autism. 
I know this is an excuse because he didn’t act this way towards me when I was in a relationship, I would never allow that out of respect for my partner. 

He had more respect for another dude’s boundaries than his own “best friend’s.” 

*Doot finds love?*

Finally, doot came to his senses and realized I wasn’t into him and wanted to find a partner for himself. I fully supported this, contrary to his belief (more on this later). I thought that if doot had found a gf our friendship could be like before, talks on Chinese history, shows, mental health, and self reflection. I really missed that. 

During this time I had been expected to ship out for army basic training and had little more than a couple of months before my ship out. Tensions started to arise when all Doot wanted to talk about was women he thought were attractive, not a problem until it gets to being 90% of the conversations. He’d show me pictures of women he found attractive on tinder that he hadn’t even matched with... and ask my opinion on them. Often I’d say “yeah she’s cute!” But occasionally I’d say “eh not really my type,” and he’d then go on and on trying to convince me of how hot the girl was to him. He’d also go on and on for hours about what he’d do to beep’s sister’s bhole. Yes, hours. It was just creepy, and annoying! I’d tell him this, but he’d just say I was jealous. I wasn’t in the slightest, I was creeped out and annoyed. There’s only so much one can hear about another someones butthole. (No he had never even seen it...) But then one day I had enough and I told him to stop sending me pictures of girls he hadn’t even matched with and just send me one he’s actually talking to, because I had enough of all the random pictures and all that nasty talk. He took offense from this, and took it as me belittling him, and basically pointing out the fact that he had never been in a relationship/struggled finding girls that’d talk to him romantically. I’ll admit I could have said it nicer, but it’s the truth, it was creepy and he needed to stop that behavior. 

From this we stop talking for a while, and then I get a taunting message from him asking if I’ve thought about how I’ve acted. As if I’m some kid in trouble that must repent to mommy. This of course made me angry. And I asked him in return if he had done the same? 

Apparently not. 

Doot goes off on a rant over the course of a couple of days over messages which I am unable to respond to quickly as I’m working weekend double shifts in a healthcare job that doesn’t have much time for anything other than work... id be lucky for a bathroom sometimes. He knew this, but continued on. Yes, I reminded him. When I’d get home I’d shower and pass out within minutes. This seemed to infuriate Doot that I wasn’t available to him. Eventually Doot decided he was done sent me a message saying he was done with me, which I replied to without a fight and wished him well. I didn’t even get a chance to explain my side.  

*a lot of stuff I forgot to mention* 

HE WAS AN ONLINE FRIEND, caps because wow I should have mentioned that ages ago I guess. 

I almost forgot to mention he’d tell me stuff I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR about his sexual desires/kinks and his experiences with self pleasure and toys... when I’d get uncomfortable I’d say, “okay stop..” and he’d just laugh and go on and on until he got out what he wanted me to hear whether I liked it or not. 

Multiple people got creeped out by him. Four  people I knew closely were very uncomfortable with how he talked about me in front of them. Anytime I tried to ask him to not talk about me that way at least not in front of other people he’d just call my other friends derogatory names. 

Doot would make me feel bad for not being with him and say things like “after all that I’ve done for you” in fights when I was getting mad at him for not respecting my boundaries. 

More details: Doot would talk sexually about me and random women while he was on speaker phone around my mom who was working from home- yes her coworkers could potentially hear his comments.. (I live in a small apartment, and my mom would walk and talk on the phone up and down the halls and she could defiantly hear us as I could easily hear her)

I’d get angry at him for this after I had warned him multiple times that he’s on speaker and my mom could hear him.. his response, “you know better than to put me on speaker!” I guess it’s my fault he can’t have a normal conversation anymore??

He keeps trying to contact me and still places blame on me in his messages. 

He’s posting in my local nsfw (that he knows I view) even though he lives across the world. 

Sorry all the errors in my writing, I’m absolutely exhausted and basically just venting.... (and a terrible writer lol)

ftocj6,Abandoned 20m by a good friend 22f,"Met this really good friend through work. I would end up asking for her number after signs of her being interested in me were obvious.

Everything went well....we went on various dates and would act like a couple.

She would occasionally tell me “hey I know we have something here but I’m not looking for a relationship okay?” But she knew I liked her

I wouldn’t push her away after she told me this, I knew she just got out of a bad relationship so I was okay with it. I had a lot of patience with her and would reinforce my patience to her constantly

We would go on to meet up a few times and do the nasty and she would always tell me how much she enjoyed it...I thought I had her in the bag, our conversation were great and the days we hanged out were almost perfect. 

We would meet up for what I didn’t know was the last time on 3/17  and do the nasty again, then we would spend the entire night just talking with each other (something tells me now that she wanted more action cause she randomly asked me “do you think I’m too horny” and now that I think about it I gave a horrible response )

Then she goes MIA on me for roughly 1.5 weeks....were the only contact I had with her was because I would try and double text...triple text sometimes even four and all I would get was a small simple response and when I tried to follow up she would avoid me.


All throughout this time I had ideas of what she was doing (found someone else) and I was right 

Last Sunday she sent me this

ftp0ej,This is all too much,"I joined this subreddit because I wanted advice on how to fix my loneliness problem, or maybe I just wanted a place to vent a little. I see now, actually being here, that it's just a very sad place filled with very sad people. I see posts from 20, 30 year olds crying out for help and it makes me so scared for myself. It makes me think I can't fix this either. I feel really bad for some of the posters here and I don't think I can stick around. It's really depressing. I know loneliness is a heavy load to bare, I've been doing it my whole life, but I can't sit here and watch people give up anymore. This place, we who are in it, just feed off of the sadness and miserable feelings. I sincerely hope everyone in this subreddit finds what they're looking for and can find some kind of happiness. We all deserve it, at least most people do. 
Please don't give up on yourself. I believe loneliness is one of the harshest pains, we're social animals and are meant to be around others. Things may change. I know I'll stop at nothing to be happy and find people again. I will not spend the rest of my life alone, I'm too young to give up and so are the rest of you. We all have it in us, and autistic kids like me.

ftsunu,Lonely and failing in life,"(First time writing on Reddit, also English isn’t my native language).

I’m a 26 years old male, and I’ve achieved nothing. 

I got issues with making friends (like real friends) for years now. I can do small talk, but it never gets anything more than that.  So now I don't have any friend to confide in. 

I study at a university in Sweden. I can’t make friends there, I barely know anyone in my class, like not even their names, because I don't talk to them and they don't talk to me. I’m also social anxious, making it even harder. Also, because of my social anxiety I’ve never been in a relationship. 

Now my studies are falling apart. I’ve restarted my university program twice now, and I failed this whole first part of the spring semester. I was having some hope that I would be able to be more sociable now, but then coronavirus happened and closed the university, meaning we now have online teaching. Even though I’m social anxious, I’m now starting to miss going to class.

I’ve now come to the realization that my feelings of loneliness and my failed education are interlinked. My feelings of loneliness destroy my motivation. I guess all I want is someone to ask how I’m doing from time to time. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ftsunu/lonely_and_failing_in_life/,ExistentialRaccoon,1,2020-04-03 04:33:50,3,/r/lonely/comments/ftsunu/lonely_and_failing_in_life/,NaN
ftt1ik,Alone after partner dumped me.,"The only person in my life i connected with left me. I have no functioning family to turn to or any friends i can connect with. 

My bf of 6 months lived with me and from the moment we woke up to going to bed we'd text about everything. Food shopping, work day, cat memes etc.
Now this person has exited my life and has blocked me on everything. Im living in a flat on my own with their ghost smothering me

I realised i dont have anyone else to chat to. I never needed to. My social needs were met by a previous job i was at when i met my ex. But during our relationship i changed jobs to a less social one but that was fine, im getting my social life with my partner now. I thought

I have lots of past aquintesses (cba to spell kek) and friends to talk to. But its not the zippy back n forth i had with my ex partner. THAT part of my brain needs someone like them to speak to. As did theirs to mine (but their social circle is big and can get that fix somewhere else)

ftt58n,Corona lockdown is causing me to slowly lose a best friend.,"I am a very emotional and sensitive person. I only have a few friends and I love them with all my heart and I think of 2 of them as my soul mates. I have never had a connection like I do with them and I never want to lose them. Since the quarantine, I haven’t been able to see one of them and she is my best friend. She has made a lot more new friends then I have and that’s great, just as long I still feel her presence in our friendship. Lately, I really haven’t been feeling her even care about me let alone our relationship, and there is nothing that really hurts more. It’s very close to the feeling of a boyfriend or girlfriend leaving you. It’s a sinking heavy weight on ur chest and feel like everything is falling and going no where at the same time. It’s breaking my heart,  and It doesn’t help that i am already 4 hours away from my partner who I haven’t been able to  see in almost a month due to covid. Just very very sad. Wish everything could go back to how it was.

fttjya,Has anyone else developed low self-esteem as a result of constant rejection?,"I don't just mean romantic rejection, by the way. (Although I can imagine, being swiped left constantly might make one feel awful about themselves. This is why I'll probably never use a dating site as long as I can help it.) I'm generally referring to social rejection. Stuff like:

* Being bullied
* Asking someone to hang out, and they always say ""no""
* Passive-aggressively shunning you
* Laughing about you behind your back
* Intentionally (or even unintentionally) excluding you from social events
* Being left on read constantly by someone
* Feeling that other people don't care about you or what you have to say (this may or may not be true, you just kinda have to vibe it out)
* No one approaching you to talk, resulting in you having nobody to talk to
   * Even if you want to approach someone, everyone's talking to each other, so there's no way to ""fit in"". Not to mention if you have social anxiety due to past rejections, it makes it even harder.
* People walking away from you when you try to have a conversation with them
* Running into someone you haven't seen in a while, and expecting ""We should catch up sometime over coffee!"" and not getting that 
* etc.

I just don't know how to feel good about myself, honestly. I imagine it's a lot easier to love yourself if other people love you, too. I know I'm not completely worthless, and I know I'm not a loser, but I still feel like one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fttjya/has_anyone_else_developed_low_selfesteem_as_a/,DonutFactoryRequiem,1,2020-04-03 05:11:30,17,/r/lonely/comments/fttjya/has_anyone_else_developed_low_selfesteem_as_a/,NaN

I never had close friends in school, and never been close to any relatives,and am an only child. It's really depressing. It worsens my anxiety too.

Every thought you have is outside the box you can bring change to everything and that’s why every thing doesn’t work well together. Because change won’t co exist with normal which is way beyond you.

My childhood was alright, and my life may have some ups and downs, but it's pretty stable right now.
I'm immature and very much alone.
I've always been a quiet kid. I was a little bit too proud and a real crybaby.
I really felt devastated after my mother died and I had to move in with a father who I didn't know much about.
But it happened when I was 14 years old and now i'm 17 and It still hurts.
Everything kinda hurts.
I have been taught to fake my smile and to never complain. Actually I was often ridiculed when I did.
So I've been faking from a while now, and I've become pretty good at it.
I'm just so used to never talk about things that are meaningful to me, it hurts when I do.
I wish I had more friends.
I never really had a lot of them.
People often say I'm weird, or they just avoid or act mean.
I guess it's easier to hang out with the cool kids.
I wish i was cool. I'm not cool at all.
I wish I could drink with someone instead of drinking rum and vodka all alone.
I've been thinking about panick attacks.
They come sometimes.
Last time the teacher got really mad at a troublesome student.
I didn't even knew her name but I emphatized with her cries and I started shaking and I wasn't able to breathe or concentrate on anything.
I wish I wasn't so sensitive.
Sometimes life feels so empty.
I'm used to reduce all of the things that could cause me stress but everyday that passes my loneliness fills me up with self doubt.
I keep on feeling bad about myself because nobody really loves me.
Everything doesn't feel happy anymore.
There are good moments but there's this thick layer of self doubt overlayed over them, and they don't feel as good anymore.
Everytime I feel bad I feel really bad.

ftzjxu,"""Can I hold you""","So i was sleeping and had a dream that I was with a girl and we spent the day together, and at the end of it we hugged and I asked her ""can I hold you for a little bit"" and she said yes then I did so in the dream, then i wake up and I'm hugging the pillow so tight that it felt real. I really need a girl who I can hold and just make the pain go away, the pillow is getting old. If i had a girl to hold I'd probably be a lot less stressed, still stressed but not nearly as much becuase work, bills and life still happen. Id be nice to have someone who I can hold and talk to about anything, but I'm not sure it'll happen. If you read this check the link, it's a really good song that is just amazing. NF your my favorite artist. I want someone to love me, that's it's....

The usual “your annoying” and “nobody likes you” are typical I’m used to them. However, lately these past few days they were really quiet. I don’t know if it was because I’ve been occupying myself with late night tasks like organizing my room or browsing the internet till 5 am and starting my day a few hours later. But this time it’s like they were regrouping and practicing a new approach with new tactics to tear me down. These thoughts came early in the night, it was only 9 o’clock. They were so violent and mean. Telling me that I don’t deserve to live and that all the mistakes I’ve made are the reason why I get to live such a lonely and shitty life. Telling me that I’m disgusting and embarrassing. Along with a slew of other thoughts that are just so violent that I’m scared to say them out loud.

fu0a11,Friendship is a non-existent concept,"Everyone keeps on shutting me out. I've literally sent texts to 4 different people who I once considered ""friends"" and none of them replied. All of them Ive known them for 4+ years, some of these people felt like fucking brothers to me. Some of these ""friends"" were people I shared every secret and piece of emotional baggage sometime in the past, and they understood and were empathetic. One guy I knew for 8 years; I haven't really kept up with him since 2018 but I saw he was online so I asked him to join my voice chat. He ended up inviting me to a chat he was already in and it was bunch of his Christian republican baseball friends (I'm trying to describe a certain stereotype, but idk what it is) so I kinda felt alienated, but it was whatever. Later on I get kicked from the voice chat so I messaged him but no reply. The thing is it feels like he couldn't give a single fuck but 2 years ago I remember him as a totally different person. The Trey I knew (dude's name) 2 years ago cheered me up when I got down and was always down to play games with me literally anytime. That person listened to everything I had to say going to shit in my life. Last night, I couldn't recognize that person. I'm crying right now as I think about it because of how much I miss that Trey, and how much better it made me feel when he wanted to spend time with me when no one else wanted to. Then, there's this other guy I texted; Tassos. Joined his lobby on a game and he removed me from the lobby right away. The text I sent him right after was along the lines of ""was just trying to catch up with an old friend, but I guess that doesn't matter"". I haven't really been up to date with him either since mid 2019, but we were practically best friends in elementary and middle school. We did a ton of shit together. We went to the mall, movies, his house, and to the parks countless times over the years. We both loved football even though we kinda sucked at it. I remember 75% of our time together was either playing Madden or some kinda game with an actual football. I had on odd personality, some people at school thought I was gay probably but he didn't give a shit. There was a time in 7th grade when one of our football teammates practically fought me and I loss before the fight even started. People thought I was a total loser and a pussy but Tassos didn't give a shit about that either. He wasn't worried about if I wasnt cool or people looked down on me. He just cared about us hanging out and being bros. Then we started to distance eventually, and he became a totally different person, shutting me out. But I learned a year later that his parents had divorced, which explained his odd behavior the year prior. So after learning that, I forgave him in my mind and in late 2018 we started to become bros again. Unfortunately I was an asshole my freshman year of high school and I'm surprised our re connection lasted as long as it did; until this school year. This school year we didn't have any classes together so we distanced again. So, about an hour ago, I see he is online, and I think I'll have a convo with him while we game, and as you, the reader, may know, he had removed me from the game lobby. I've already spilled so much onto the internet to people I don't even know, so I won't detail about the 2 other people. But this shit sucks.

fu0gft,Having a rough night. 32F if it makes a difference to you.,"I generally try pretty hard to stay optimistic and positive, but I’m really struggling tonight and could just use some reassurance. 

It’s been a hard year(ish). Dealt with some pretty serious health stuff with my dad in Feb ‘19, got dumped by my fiancé in April ‘19 (and later found out he left me for another girl who is younger, prettier, thinner and just all around better than me; he ended our engagement in a text message, lied to me about why he left, and was almost certainly cheating with this girl - emotionally if not yet physically), I’ve had a series of expensive events with my animals (vet bills in the THOUSANDS of dollars, which includes a surgery for my dog because he ruptured a disc and without the surgery would have been paralyzed at best), a generally precarious situation at work (higher ed in a program whose funding keeps getting cut PLUS I work for someone who is literally causing me to go insane), and now I’m trapped at home and have lost my second job (which is literally what pays my rent) because of the pandemic. I have a sinus surgery scheduled for the middle of the month which I absolutely cannot afford, but I also can’t afford not to have it done for health reasons. I’m exhausted all the time, I’m gaining weight I don’t need to gain because I’m in so much pain (and also can’t BREATHE, see the need for the surgery), so I feel fat and ugly and generally gross. I have a ton of debt; I’m able to pay it (or at least I have been - not having this second job is seriously scary and there is very little opportunity to find something else here at the moment because everything is locked down and laying people off). It’s been over a year since I’ve had any kind of intimate contact with anyone, (and I mean that literally, not even so much as a HUG) and dating has been a joke even before quarantine hit - college town where I definitely don’t fit the general demographic, plus see above fat and ugly and gross.

Long story short, I’m lonely and sad and freaking out a little bit. 

I don’t really have any friends; I have a few acquaintances that I am in no way comfortable talking about any of this, and the couple actual friends I have have heard all of this feeling sorry for myself so much that I’m afraid to push them away by talking about it any more. I don’t want to burden them any further, and I’m sick of hearing about me - so I know they must be. 

But I was speaking to someone on Reddit recently, and I think they meant well, but their response to everything I said (when I was really making an effort NOT to complain) was to say how bad my life sucks and how hard what I’ve gone through is and how glad they are not to be me. Which, yeah, it does suck. Yes, it has been that long. No, there’s nothing left to cut or sell or whatever. Thanks for reminding me how shitty everything is day in and day out, as if I didn’t spend every waking hour trying (and often failing, no matter how hard I try) NOT to let that overwhelm me. 

If you’ve made it this far, you’re an angel. I think I needed a little bit of an outlet just so this wasn’t all in my head, but if anybody has some kind words or whatever, I would appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fu0gft/having_a_rough_night_32f_if_it_makes_a_difference/,soileilunetoile,1,2020-04-03 12:04:30,21,/r/lonely/comments/fu0gft/having_a_rough_night_32f_if_it_makes_a_difference/,NaN

fu0p8l,Quarantine," When I got to know that social isolation would be a thing, I thought I'd be able to muster it easily - I'm used to have most of my prevalent social interaction online my whole life, and maybe people would have extra time to spend with me!

fu0ycd,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music","Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

fu14df,Every day I lose a fight,"It's been 257 days since I move to a new town. 241 days since I started a new job. But it's been over a year since I had a life change that made me challenge what I'm waking up each day for. For two years I grew each day working and doing what I could to make that special someone's life better. After all that ended, I found I didn't know what I wanted to wake up for each day. Sure working kept my mind busy, and it helped the time pass but each day I went to bed not knowing how I was going to make the next day pass. 

Each day I think I'll do something to improve my life. Find something I like doing that makes me healthier, be it physically, mentally, socially, or emotionally. Some days I came out strong, went to the gym for a few days in a row, or even making it a few weeks. Making meals for myself instead of fast food or snaking on granola bars and peanuts made me think I was on the track to setting my life back up. But one small slip, or just getting the doubt in my head set me back each time. 

I don't know how those out there win their daily battles, or lose them and get up the next day ready to fight like it's the first time all over again.  I've always been a hands-on learner, progressing best when put into the situation. Through the years or therapy sessions I've never found how to take home the will to keep trying when the only thing/person/idea that knows what's happening, is me.

fu1qnr,I (25F) am willing to get back into an unhappy relationship just to not feel lonely,"I dated this guy (25M) for about 10 months. At the start it was really great, but overtime things turned sour and we realized that we just weren't right for eachother. We weren't abusive towards eachother persay, but we argued a lot, always were super passive aggressive with eachother and just weren't a good fit. 
   In the past 4 months since our breakup, I can't shake my reoccurring feelings of loneliness and longing. Once you add in the recent events related to social distancing, it gets way worse. Everyday I wake up and I realize that I have no one and that I'll have to learn to accept the fact that it's just going to be me myself and I for a while. 
   I want to loved, I want to have a sense of belonging, I want someone to be with me, I want to not be lonely. I want these things so much that I am totally ok with going back to being in an unhappy and unfulfilling relationship, just to have the feeling that I'm not alone.
   I would go back to being in a relationship where nights end in slammed doors and days begin in awkward silences if it meant that I would feel as if I would have a companion, that I had a place in someone's life, that I wasn't all alone, that it wouldn't just be me left alone with my doubts, fears, and insecurities.
   At the end of the day, all anyone really wants is to have a person to spend their life with. In some cases they want that so bad, that they'll do practically anything for it, good or bad.

fu28cd,New member with a story,"Wasn’t always lonely. Never had a girlfriend but had a couple friends. It all happened over a few days. The first one I lost was who I’ll call Sam. Sam was cool, she liked the things I liked, and was emo. Perfect. We used to text every night, believe it or not. Called me her best friend.

One day I invited her over to my house, it was Winter Break and cabin fever is a bitch (fucking kappa at that hindsight). She told me she had a lot of work and family, which I was cool with. We’re in high school so it’s good to work as much as you can to save up and shit.

A week or so after Winter Break, I ask her over again and she tells me she can’t. She told me she was going out with the boys. At first I said “duhh ok” but I thought about it more and more and I came to the conclusion that she was straight up blowing me off.

This was a total sperg moment on my end but I woke up and texted her asking why she was blowing me off. Turns into an argument, then I realize that I’m definitely the asshole right now. I apologized and said we’ll talk later.

5 hours later, I get a text from a dude saying if he saw me near her again he would beat the shit out of me. She legitimately contracted this twig-boy JROTC cuck to be her bodyguard. I took this as her “breaking up with me” and removed her from everything.

My second friend (we’ll call her Adrian) was weird but I liked talking with her. She was the kind of person who didn’t know what porn was and still played Coolmath games.

A little after Soldier Boy shakes me up, I text Adrian that me and Sam were done being friends (Sam and Adrian were friends long before we met, I thought it was pertinent) and she told me she didn’t want to know about it. I respected her request.

Two fucking weeks later, she stops texting me. I can almost guarantee that Sam has lied about me twice to ruin my reputation just because of one mistake. So now I’m pretty much completely alone. My dad is cold and emotionally unavailable and my mother is just cold.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fu28cd/new_member_with_a_story/,corizeus_,1,2020-04-03 14:07:47,2,/r/lonely/comments/fu28cd/new_member_with_a_story/,NaN

fu3jkq,Falling Further,"236am. Anxiety has returned. Everyone seems to be asleep. I’m running on empty, but the silence won’t shut up and let me sleep.

Life feels desaturated. The color is draining from the world, pudding into a mess under an empty canvas. So much opportunity, but it’s all been wasted. I managed to survive, but to what end? The sky is the limit, or so they say, but how can I reach it when I’m apparently stuck on the ground?

I hate how I feel. My soul writhes inside my body, twitching under the sheets on my bed. The key on my back is constantly tightening the spring in my chest. Wound up like a toy, but never allowed to run free. When will it be enough? What a cruel existence to silently suffer. No one sees the tension. Or maybe they do, and steer clear. I could snap at any minute... 

But I can’t escape. Never escape. Nobody helps.

I desperately want to be something, to somebody. I don’t even have to be a person to that somebody. At least I wouldn’t be pointless then. At least I could pretend to be human then.


250am. Help. I don’t know how to speak to anyone. I don’t know how to communicate. I can’t relate this. I’m just so anxious. I can’t rest. Some one give me a reason to wake up, so that I can finally sleep. Because if there’s nothing coming with the morning, then I’d rather it just always be night.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fu3jkq/falling_further/,atari1993,1,2020-04-03 15:53:41,1,/r/lonely/comments/fu3jkq/falling_further/,NaN

Honestly, whole conversations with a fake man

I always come to the point where I'm convinced that deep down everybody is lonely as hell, traveling though this life as an isolated consciousness.   
The moments in which this isolation is not felt   
are merely due to being distracted from the realities of the state in which we exist,   
and not because we have remedied our loneliness.  


Probably just depressed  
Will probably be content again at some point and shed this melancholy,  
can't happen soon enough if you ask me.

fu55ww,I'm starting to notice some of the disturbing behaviors I had as a lonely child,"I was born an only, introverted child with mildly overprotective parents. This made ever talking to people a big challenge. I didnt have any brothers or sisters to talk to, I had very few friends to talk to, especially before first grade. I knew hardly anyone on my street. I spent basically all of my childhood alone, even online (I had a wii, didnt even get the classic call of duty voice chat experience).

And recently I've noticed it really had an effect on me. Because I never really hung out with anyone, I always asked practically anyone who *might* say yes to just playing a video game with me, even grown adults who almost always said no.

My parents also divorced when I was young, and I never really got to talk to anyone about it. Recently I remembered just how much I used to bring it up to people at the worst times. I brought it up to family, friends, even teachers. It made them all uncomfortable, and I didnt stop until i realized just how uncomfortable it made people.

fu5h23,Still thinking about them(REALLY LONG SRRY),"So I’m a 17F and I just kind of want to vent or say what I’ve been feeling lately. Uhm so two years ago I logged back into a game i hadn’t played for years and saw that someone I used go talk to on the game was online. I caught up with them and we always talked only on the game like where u could message each other. Then he told me his insta and I gave him mine and we quickly became close. I then caught feelings for him after a few weeks of DMing on insta. So I would do anything to get his attention. I sent him pictures of me so he wouldn’t think I’m some creep and he sent me his. He was cute I mean he was okay but at the time I REALLY like him. He would livestream on insta where he played guitar and I would always watch and talk to him. Then he just randomly started telling me how horny he was. I was 15 at the time and was like “woah what” and he’s tell me how he’s hard and stuff. I didn’t wanna say anything but that’s all he’d talk about. We’d talk about our fav bands and then he’d be like “I’m so horny”. So I’d say “well just watch some porn and finish it” but he’d say “no I don’t wanna watch any of that” so I just left it at that. The next day he told me how he came thinking about me. I was really like “what😐” and he would just tell me all the cross details like what his cum felt like and ugh it was just gross. After that I stopped talking to him for a bit. I was going through a lot at the time. I’m not gonna self diagnose myself but I did try to kill my self at that time and was failing in school cause I just planned to die and no one I knew irl knew about my situation. I started self harming and ended up with no one to talk to but some online friends. But at the time I rlly fucked up and pushed away one of my closest internet friends so I had no one. Then one day he texted me “hey how u doing “ and we started talking. He then mentioned role play and wanted me to role play with him and then I got really uncomfortable. I repeatedly told him how I didn’t want to do that. And he would keep pushing me like “come on do this for me” “it’s okay if you don’t know how to just follow my lead” and at the time I didn’t have my own room I shared with my sister and he wanted to do it over the phone. I thought “he wants me to moan so he can get off or something” so I just ignored his messages. At this time I then met some people online through my art Instagram and I’m still close with them to this day. I sent them what he was telling me to do and they were like “block him he’s a creep” “don’t do that he’s using you” but at the time he was the only one I was close to I didn’t want to lose him. I said “okay I blocked him” but would keep talking to him. Things soon escalated. I think by this point he figured out I liked him and started to say things to get me jealous. He’d talk about how many cute girls are at his school (since he lived in Washington and I live in Texas he’d tell me bout people) and how one girl even showed him her boobs. I would tell him “can you not talk about other girls boobs”. He then kept talking about their size and how he likes any size. Then he was like “well send me pics of u so I could see what size yours are”. As I mentioned before I was going through a lot of self harm and had issues with my self esteem. So I gave in. I sent him a pic of my boobs(not naked I had my shirt on but it was the first time I ever did something like that”. I remember then feeling so ashamed that I just did that and he replied “they’re cute” and idk why my 15 yr old self thought that it was such an amazing compliment. But at the time I was like “OMG the boy I like called me cute”. I then started to give in when he wanted me to send pictures.  He made me feel special you know? He made me feel pretty and good about myself. Almost every week I sent him pics like that. Some with a bralette, some with a tank top and he even told me to hold a pencil up by putting it in between my boobs and squishing then together. At times I told him no but then he’d talk about how girls in his school could easily do it for him so I get jealous and did it. I thought he’d really be into me if I satisfied his needs. Then I started looking up how to pose differently so he wouldn’t get bored of my photos. Then I saw how some girl commented under this blog I think. I said “girls don’t do this. Have some more respect for yourself and stop sending gross pictures” I thought “what is she talking about” then saw how other girls were going through the same thing as me. How guys would ask for pics when they are most vulnerable. This opened my eyes to what was really happening. I realized then and there, he just wanted to cum to my pictures. He doesn’t really care about me. Then I think a week later I told him I didn’t want to talk to him because I was going through stuff and I needed time to myself. It was kind of a lie to get rid of him but I really wasn’t mentally stable at the time. He then was understanding and was like “okay text me if you ever need someone to talk to”. At this point I kind of still had feelings for him but i was confused if I was overreacting or not. But I soon forgot about him. I finished the 10th grade and was pretty happy. I stopped cutting myself, the scars were healing and I was just having fun with my friends. Then I got a text from him saying “I miss you.” I felt bad for forgetting about him but I reminded myself that he doesn’t really like me and will just use me. I then told him how uncomfortable I was sending pictures and he got mad. He was like “I didn’t force you!?” And I lashed out and mentioned how he tries to make me jealous by mentioning girls for me to send him pictures of me. He denied even talking about other girls and we fought. I said “I don’t want to talk to you anymore” and he was like “******(my name) come on I need you don’t leave me”. It hurt to do but I blocked him and let it at that. I think about him a lot lately. Especially with this quarantine and how everyone is lonely now. I don’t know he just pops up in my mind. I think it’s because I never really got closer. I once checked his insta and seemed like he was doing fine so I stopped checking. He really didn’t even care about me. All this time he used me for his own personal needs. I still have major self esteem issues. I’m not really pretty and I’m not really skinny. I’m an average ugly girl and knowing that makes me think I won’t ever find someone. I realize I need to be happy on my own. Be myself and to find self love but at times like these it’s hard and I just delve into my self pity thoughts. I really hate it. I wish I had money to get plastic surgery. I really hate myself for even thinking about him.

fu5ud8,The spiraling thoughts of an insomniac,"I just found out this sub existed a few minutes ago and I’m not really sure what to post so sorry if my thoughts seem disjointed. It’s five am now and of course my thoughts have started to get existential and what not. 

The worst part of this whole quarantine thing is that I’m now realizing how little my day to day life has changed. Normally my schedule is just me going to class then going home or to pick up something from the grocery store then go to bed. As for human contact I’ll talk to my teachers if asked a question I might talk to one of my peers if they engage me first and when I get home I might talk to one of my parents for a bit since I have no siblings to chat with. I have no idea how I haven’t gone crazy yet. 

My biggest regret is never really making any friends I had people I’d known and talked to since kindergarten but I never really felt any sort of connection with them despite how nice they all were and I certainly never felt the need to get to know them outside of school. Now I’m in college and I’ve lost all ties with them and have been left with nothing. Oh and the only real friend I ever managed to make ghosted me after moving back to her hometown.

And the cherry on top of my sad life is that I’ll probably just keep on being like this I can’t start any conversations with people much less hold them long enough to establish any kind of meaningful relationship at this rate I’ll never make any friends or find a significant other and will wind up utterly alone save for the 5 cats I’ll probably adopt as I begin my life as a senile old cat lady.

Or maybe I’m just being melodramatic and my life really isn’t over at 19.

fu5ulu,I have no one to talk to about something making me miserable. I was rejected from a scholarship for graduate school. I texted the only friend I have and she has left me on read.,"Hi guys, I received my grad school decision today. While it turns out that I did get a place in the program, I didn't get the scholarship. I feel incredibly low and having no one to comfort me is making dealing with this rejection even worse. I texted my only friend these days and she didn't really respond. I am not surprised because she's academically gifted and smart, so I don't think she has anything to say to a loser like me. There is another friend I can tell, but he is studying at a top-tier university on a prestigious scholarship, and I don't want him to think that I am dumb. My few other friends haven't checked up on me in weeks, and I don't think they care. I am always everyone's second choice, and I am always the one reaching out. I can hardly call that friendship, now that I think about it. I also feel guilty for thinking that they should care because they have their own lives and I am not the center of their existence. I can't tell my family because they're going to be upset and disappointed in me.

fu5zc1,I was only good for her when she had no one else.,"She was very special to me. I cared about her so much, told her things I had never told anyone before in my life. She had this energy about her that I really cant explain, her presence was enough to make me happy, even just a text would suffice to brighten my day.

Yesterday, after a few months of growing more and more distant, I texted her and told her I couldn't continue to try and be in her life because it hurts too much to be put off to the side all the time. Her response shattered me. She basically told me that when she met me she had no one else and that's why we were so close. Now she has more friends so she can't keep up with me anymore.

I was there for her whenever she needed, sat on the phone when all she could do was cry because she was so depressed. I would talk her out of self harming when she was really bad, at least I would try to. We shared details of our lives with eachother that were personal and sacred. I promised never to judge her, and I still stand by that.

All I can say is that I'm broken hearted. How can someone I thought so highly of just not care? I'm shattered and could really use someone to talk to because social distancing has got me feeling extremely lonely.

fu70kv,I “confessed” to my crush but...,"This whole situation started about a year ago. I had begun talking to this girl and eventually developed feelings for her. We talked for another 4 months or so before I mustered up the courage to ask her out. She replied gleefully with a yes and all was well, we had made plans to go ice skating together and I was generally really happy with what we had. 

The day before ice skating was due to go ahead she bailed, saying that “she didn’t feel well”. I was a bit upset at the time but didn’t think any more of it. About a week after this happened, out of the blue she texted me saying something along the lines of “BTW, my parents aren’t allowing me to date for at least the next 2 years, they want me to be able to focus more on schooling rather than these other things”. This broke my heart and it made me quite annoyed and frustrated. In the beginning I started to think these were all excuses to get me off her tail, it all added up that way it seemed, but as time passed I eventually learnt that this was indeed the case (as stupid as it may seem). 

Months and months passed, we continued to talk day after day, and we became more and more comfortable with each other. We shared insecurities and talked about our problems and issues, it was a very healthy friendship (much to my disappointment). Every once in a while I would casually flirt with her, just to let her know that I’m still into her. I had never felt this way about a person before and I couldn’t manage myself to let it slip past me again. As we become more comfortable our conversations became much more personal and deep. She shared things about her life that no one should ever have to experience, and I provided emotional support vice versa. Needless to say the more I learnt about this amazing person the more my little crush for her turned into love.

As more time went past, we both began to slip away from each other in terms of a romantic relationship level. She told me how she never really felt attracted to me, and I began to doubt even my own feelings. I tried to distance myself from her as an attempt to numb my feelings of love for her but I couldn’t manage it. It was becoming an obsession. I felt as though I wasn’t good enough for her, for anyone. I felt hopeless and sad. I slowly dipped into a depressive state that I still haven’t come out of yet.

The purpose of this was to talk about how I “confessed to her” just recently. I explained what my feelings for her have done to me and how much it has destroyed me over the last year. I realised the reason she couldn’t let me go and flirted back as a means of making me stay, she was using me to dump all her problems and issues onto. It was so much that it was taking a toll on my mental health. But I played along, played along because I pitied her. She was lying straight to my face, telling me that if I wait, we could be together once again, yet she continued to talk about the possibility of having feelings for someone else. If I had the opportunity, I wish I could stop whatever feelings I have for her.

But...I can’t, I’m so lonely right now, she’s the only one that really talks to me consistently. I wouldn’t know where I’d be without her...I guess one of the reasons I can’t make myself forget about her is because I’d become even more isolated and lonely...idk what to do.

fu71q4,Most Important Advice I’ve Gotten From My Therapist,"Hey everyone, I want to share the most important piece of wisdom I got from my therapist.
So a year ago i was in a really rough place and started seeing a therapist because i was feeling lonely and depressed all the time. I told him that I didn’t have any friends or anyone to make me feel socially connected and this 
1. Made me feel super down and lonely all the time, (especially on weekends) and
2. Made me really question my worth as a person.

****He told me that even though in my current situation I didn’t have anyone to connect with, this didn’t mean I was a bad person or I was doomed to live my life without buddies. He said it was most likely due to the fact that I was constantly surrounded by the same handful of people every day and that i just didnt happen to click with anyone around me.****

He was right! A few months from him saying this new people had entered my life and others had exited, and I clicked with a few of the new people and now find myself in a great friend group.

The lesson here is to trust life and trust the fact that things change!!!! Question yourself when you start to beat yourself down and realize like I did that a lot of loneliness is just about the environment you find yourself in and says little about you as a person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fu71q4/most_important_advice_ive_gotten_from_my_therapist/,sudokuPancake,1,2020-04-03 20:52:35,18,/r/lonely/comments/fu71q4/most_important_advice_ive_gotten_from_my_therapist/,NaN

fu9tdp,Feeling two different types of lonely," I don't have my mother anymore and my grandma passed a year ago very suddenly. My mother passed away from breast cancer back in 2014 and I haven't been the same since. It doesn't help that I've been dreaming about my mom and my grandma a lot recently. They're beautiful dreams too, one where everything is normal and my mom is being her normal loving and caring self. I'm laughing and I feel like myself again only to wake up once I start to realize in my dream that she's actually gone. It's like clockwork every time, the dream is going well and then my brain snaps to reality and I start coming out of the dream still talking to my mother out loud then I cut myself off once I'm fully awake because I realize it was just a dream and I'm talking to myself and then I get depressed.. 

Life has been so difficult for me and I was in a constant loop of trying to heal that wound by being with women but that never worked. If anything it just made my issue worse. I felt like I was using them while they were giving it their all and being an amazing girlfriend for me but at the time I didn't feel that way. Now I'm alone and haven't had a significant relationship in 2 years (which is fine because I'm focusing on myself) but I'm starting to really miss having someone there although I know right now I don't need it. I don't want to step back into that loop of getting with someone when I'm so broken and not being able to love them the same way they love me.. I've done it too many times now. At times I feel like I deserve this for the way those relationships ended and I don't think it's wrong to think that way but at the same time I am really hard on myself.

Idk the point of this post. I just wanted to vent and I can't go to my therapist because she's not working at the moment due to all this virus stuff going on. I feel a little better now.

fu9tdr,On loneliness and regret; you should feel less lonely with your partner than without them.,"When my ex called the night I was trying to end things with an FWB I don't love, he said I'd betrayed him but that he was so lonely and would want to be friends once he's forgiven me for the betrayal (telling his mom we married just for the bureaucracy but that I did love him with all my heart and mind and soul, the latter of which I'm not so certain I believe in anyway.) He said things were getting more serious with his new partner... but that he was lonely. No one understands him. I'm a friend. 

He's my first love. He'll be my last and only love too, no matter what comes with future partners. I cannot love like that again. Could not, if I wanted to. I've already healed too much since.

The time before this he'd told me he'd been casually seeing someone too young, though he lied about her age, and with values that don't align with his own. That mine had aligned so much better than hers.

He's my first love. He's hurt me like his wife had hurt him. Sometimes people leave us a bit broken.

His mom taught me Finnish and how to have enough *sisua* and the grit to get through anything, to approach life with Stoa. A good friend to me now, but as a kid a tough mom to have, grieving his dad. And merely a mask, so he said... but a mask I chose to trust nonetheless. My ex is a survivor. His previous ex abused him, taught him all the things love isn't, all the ways it can be used to manipulate someone, to make them feel guilty. Lessons I'd learned at home and unlearned with friends before I met him, having come out of my family and first sexual experiences broken, having learned what love isn't, having been taught my mind and body are broken, having learnt firsthand what is not consensual, before I learned what these are.

Someday, I hope to meet him again as strangers now. That is all we are, as that is what he needs, as he plays me into divorce, a divorce I'd freely have granted had he helped me and lied less and been honest and open all along. I needed to heal. And it was too little too late, and I got hurt again in the process since things ended between us.

It's all behind us now. But I met my best fit, and married him before I learned how to just be with anyone. 

The right person, at the wrong time.

Tomorrow is our second anniversary... a meaningless date. But an important one bureaucratically, which is why I suppose I will be blocked until our divorce is finalized. 

My heart is shattered. My hopes destroyed.

fuc3i9,"I knew I was alone, but not quite this alone.","Im not entirely sure why as I had been trying to reach out to friends prior to this lockdown and covid stuff. No body ever wants to hang out. Most of the time i just get left on read or some have the respect to just decline hanging out for one reason or another. This has beeb going on over the last few years. Slowly i went from a popular guy with a decent amount of friends. I get as adults our schedules dont always have similar free times. But the Last time i saw a friend outside of my family was back around Christmas/Halloween-ish 2019 (somewhere between those months) it gad gotten so bad that when me and my ex split up i had to move back in with family because none of my friends that would still reply to me didnt have room. At this point i cut nearly everybody who always leave me on read out of my life. If they cant spare a minute or two to talk in a time of need, or ever for that matter than I guess I could pick a better friend. (To clarify some of these people have left me on read for multiple messages over the course of months. They plenty of time to respond when time opened up.) This left me back at my familys home, with like 5 friends that would still message or whatever and 2 of them over the next year took time to hang out with me. They were very appreciated days. Over the course of a year, these five friends still talking to me dwindled down too these last twothat were willing to actually hangout. And around Halloween/christmas I saw 1 friend for a beer and havent herd from him since. And the other friend mostly has been quiet and I have been as well. 

To continue, my life growing up had been filled with my father making fun of me, growing up (I am a male) I had grown my hair out, by grown out i mean the hair on my hairline barely touched my chin. So maybe 7 inch long hair. And my father would always tell me to cut my hair because i look like a woman, would buy me ""gag gifts"" of tampons and mention how cute id look in that dress at the store. My older brother just kind of up and left us all when he turned 18, over the years my younger sister has said she just tolerates me being around,  my mother is the type that when I pet her dog and it for appearantly no reason decided to bite me, she yelled at me and started asking me why i was harassing the dog. Basically my point with that is its been like that with her over the last like 12 years (im 28 now). And all of this must have affected my home life because my youbger brotger has announced to me that he cant stand being around me and is moving half eay across the country to not have to be around me. 

I have 1 friend who basically never talks to me anymore. And im stuck in a house around people who dont care about me and dont want to be around me. And I have no way out because literally everybody ive known has left except 1 guy who is married and has a busy life.  

I giggle to myself when I see those posts like hey check on your ""insert stereotypical extrovert type or person"" they dont do good being alone. They dont even know the meaning of alone. 

But ALAS, i wish to not be here any longer. I dont want to have to deal with the loneliness anymore. BUT... momma aint raise no quitter. So that option doesnt work for me  I might be the saddest ive ever been in my life, but im not that weak.

fucwf3,I wanna stop loving.,"I dropped out of school a couple years ago to focus on something else, and even though I feel much better doing my thing, every single day I feel painfully aware that I've lost all my friends. I wasn't a lonely person at school, I've had friends that I felt like I would be together for a lifetime, yet now I realize that I've lost them without even noticing. Days go by one by one and looking back, I don't have a single guy to talk to.


This made me desperate to have some kind of an emotional connection with someone, anyone and then I happened to meet a girl online, someone who lives in another part of the globe. Maybe it's cus that she's been my only friend for a year by now, I've grown so attached to her, more than I've been with anyone else. All this without even seeing her. But everything has to end, right? I feel like she's moving on, I mean, you can't do much with someone you know just through texts. This makes me realize the position I'm gonna be in very soon, she's able to move on to other friends of hers and be happy and feel in company, while I can't even keep her out of my thoughts for a moment. Everything I see connects to her and our conversations in some way, and I want it to remain magical like how it was, even as I know it's impossible. She's able to ""get bored"" and ignore my texts for days, that's normal, people grow apart, but what hurts is that I can't do the same to her. Or to anyone else. I still miss people I had split with years ago, it still hurts me while I'm sure that they've forgotten all memories of me. I just... wanna stop caring for them. I want to have other friends I can move on to, but I don't. 


And I do feel like I'm worrying too much for nothing, it's all a part of life isn't it? But thinking that makes me feel worse about myself cus I maybe whining over such small issues, I don't really know. All I know is I cry every now and then remembering the past and worrying about the future.

fucxr0,I feel invisible to most people.,"I'm ignored at school. A lot. I honestly don't know why I'm worrying about this while I'm off school until (probably) the summer holidays, but I need to get this off my chest while I still can. 

Of course I have friends, but sometimes I feel out of place with them. That's why I spend my break and lunchtimes alone. 

While I sit staring at my phone, or reading a book (yes I am a total nerd), or simply doing nothing, I keep looking around to see if someone might notice me and talk to me. No one. Not even my crush (well he'd probably be staring at me).

I'm not a very talkative person at school. I'm also terribly shy. So I think if anyone came up to talk to me I'd mess it up big time. I often get on with my school day very quietly while everyone else around me is socializing just fine.

fud4j8,Maybe I’m destined to be alone...,"I’m almost 27 years old and I’m starting to think that maybe I’m just not meant for anyone. It seems that every girl I talk to or end up getting close to ends up gaslighting me or just flat out telling me I’m not good enough. The handful of relationships that I’ve actually been in have all ended in disaster. I either get cheated on or I end up finding out about some horrible lie that was told to me that ruins everything. I don’t understand. I’m not the most emotional guy out there but fuck...I just want some companionship. Someone that’s equally interested in me that I am in them. Someone who won’t lie or cheat. Someone who actually cares about my ambitions and livelihood. Someone who wants to build something spectacular in life. But the more I try, even the more I “let love come to me”, the more I’m disappointed. And being an educated black guy in an area of the country where there’s predominantly white people presents its own unique set of challenges. You know, I’ve literally had multiple girls tell me to my face that I’m “too nice.” If only you knew how crippling those words are. And I can’t even count the number of times someone’s told me that they’re interested in me, only to find out that they’ve been fucking someone else for months. It’s almost as if I have to be 6’2” with washboard abs, a 9 1/2” dick and a criminal record to be taken seriously by anybody. Normally I’m able to just shake this stuff off and get back to making money but I can’t even do that right now due to the current “situation”. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m finding myself slipping into a crippling depression because the idea of having to spend my life alone....it’s terrifying. 

And to the person that commented on and earlier post and called me desperate....
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting to be with someone that’s not going to lie or cheat on you.

fudbzo,I don't know what to do and need advice,"I'm a 20M university student. I wouldn't call myself smart but everyone else always seems to think I'm some genius or something. This makes it really hard for me to connect with people because I've always been focused on education and my intellectual development to meet the expectations that were put on me and I never developed emotionally.
A month or 2 after starting university, I started having feelings for 1 of my close friends, this opening up a new range of emotions that are still very alien to me. Eventually, me and this friend had a chat and decided to remain friends. That hurt but at least we were still really good friends.

About 2 months after all of that, me and her started disagreeing and arguing a lot over the most insignificant things, almost as if we were intentionally trying to hurt each other. This lead to us deciding to take a break from being friends. In the space of a week, we went from spending a minimum of 3hrs a day texting, on the phone or actually doing something together to 0 contact.
At this point, I started having a lot of problems. It started as just loneliness and feeling as though I had been broken up with, evolving into low self-esteem, self-hatred, self-deprication and depression which just keeps getting worse. I've tried getting a referral for some counselling but everything is shutdown because of the Coronavirus pandemic. Being locked down at home also hasn't helped, increasing the rate that the problems are growing at exponentially compared with while I was at university.

It has been 3 months since that happened and I'm now at a point where I can't get through a day without having had at least 4 anxiety attacks with depressive episodes that will last 2-3 days at a time.
Before all of this occurred, I was able to compartmentalise all my thoughts and feelings but since my ""break up"", this hasn't been possible at all.

What can I do to get over this loneliness and anxiety because I'm scared that unless I do something soon, I may actually spend my life alone.

fueac3,out of fucks to give,"This be a long post so yeah

I just wanna get this off my chest somehow. I dont care if this dies in new. I just dont wanna keep this to myself

I dunno. I feel like despite the events around me, I just dont care anymore 

A majority of my only group of friends in school are going on a different track (IB) for Senior High while I’m going on the other track (Standard) with only 2 of my friends, only one of which is going on the same track (ABM track) as me, but he has a lot of other strong connections with other friends overshadowing me. Also, knowing the people who are going on my track and the added bonus of me being an introvert, I am going to have a tough time making friends. I am looking at a possible 2 years of loneliness, but despite knowing this, I don’t think I care much

My online friend, who was suicidal ((some context)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f8r4k5/how_do_i_stop_a_friend_from_committing_suicide_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf]), came back on Discord a few days ago after some time of silence and told me that he was doing well. He told me his friends were planning some big party for his birthday on a July and there’s gonna be like 85 people going (kinda odd considering the corona virus stuff going on right now). It’s nice that he’s getting better but i dunno, i just dont feel happy for him for some reason. 

I have another online friend who’s also has depression because of family problems and some other crap. We’re not exactly good friends, but she went inactive for a while on the discord server and considering her mental state, I kinda got worried, so I checked on her. I think she said something about how she just doesnt care anymore. I didnt know what to say so I replied with something like “good luck with your troubles” or some shit like that and she said “Thank you, [OP’s name]. honestly thank you so much.” Im not sure if that was sarcastic or not. 
Fast forward to like a week later or something, I join her server on the Roblox game she’s playing and I do my usual messing around with her by standing on her head and saying “poop” then she tells me to fuck off on Discord because Im being disrespectful to her and her girlfriend (who was with her on the server). It’s nice that she has someone to support her in a way that I cant, but i dunno, I feel like the efforts I put into trying to help her went nowhere, but eh, who cares? 

One of my irl friends recently messaged me to ask if I know if anything’s going on with our other friend (I’ll call him Waldo). He told me that he’s worried that something’s wrong with Waldo because Waldo messaged him to ask how to drop out of the club that my group of friends (except me, because I would suck ass in that club) are in for “personal reasons” and he’s been inactive in our group chat. My friend said that we should probably wait a while before checking on Waldo. i think it’s because he doesnt want Waldo to know that my friend told me about his decision. I’m a real fucking asshole for forgetting about him considering that we’re good friends (we’ve gone on sleepovers for school projects and we’re often in the same group for school projects, shit like that), but I don’t feel like it. 
Im definitely a hypocrite cuz I wish that someone would think about me, but I forgot about him despite the years we’ve been friends. I dont feel the regret though

Sometimes, I wonder if I’m wasting my time trying to get to Australia just to give my online friend a hug. I have a general plan for this. So first, Im gonna look for colleges around her area (she gave me one college I can go to that’s near her place), then I have 2 choices.
A) Im gonna convince my parents to let me check out the college sometime (prolly November or early next year). I go there, take a taxi to her house, then see her. After that, I dunno
B) I go to study college in Australia after graduating Senior High. Then I’ll meet her while I’m studying. I have to wait longer for this one.
I dunno, is our relationship good enough to be worth the trouble? I think she’s willing to send me photos that has her in it because I send her a lot of mine. I think that’s some kind of sign but I dunno really. But eh

Sometimes, I look at my cabinet. My belt is in there. I imagine drinking the beer in the fridg then hanging the belt around my neck. But eh, just shrug it off

Thats all the shit I can think of right now, but there’s probably some more that I cant recall for some reason

So I'm a 20 year old girl? I'll be turning 21 next month and I recently found out from a friend that I'm adopted. I've always had my doubts but brushed it off. But it always bothered some way or the other but not much till I found out it was true. I really want to know why my parents hid the truth from me but I'm also scared to ask cuz I feel like I may lose my feelings for them or may have a hard time addressing them as mom and dad for a while.

For a few years now I've been getting this weird feeling that right after I graduate from my college my parents are gonna throw me out of the house and disown me...idk why but I just do. 

I also feel like I have a very relationship with my parents and the people around me like my friend or professors. I feel like people don't really trust me and avoid telling me a lot of things. They feel like it's not necessary to involve me in stuff and I feel left out but I try not get to carried away by it but it still bothers me on those days where you cry yourself to sleep.

fugj67,need dating advice (19F),"Just to give you some background: 
I’m a very loving person, I care a lot about my friends and the people around me. I love going out with people and just having a fun time- I’m extroverted and am trying to get my teaching degree in Biology. My personality is a very “mama- bear” type of style. I come from a Southern rooted environment and have dreamt about finding my husband, planning our wedding, and having kids of my own in my twenties. 
Recently, I’ve become so lonely to the point that I will find myself crying because of how empty my heart feels. (Play chasin you by Morgan Wallen when ur driving at night and you will too) I just want my heart to glow. It sounds weird but I truly feel that when you meet the right person your heart will glow &lt;3
My friends are constantly saying that I have “the best personality and that I’m absolutely gorgeous” - that I “radiate love and warmth” etc etc. We’re all surprised I haven’t met the love of my life by now lol. 

But, there’s just so many things wrong with me when I try to date. I had this cute guy who treated me with a lot of respect, he begged to take me out for Valentine’s Day. He wanted to take me iceskating and teach me since he’s a professional hockey player. I denied him and cut it off last minute. Why?!?! 

My entire life everyone has told me how beautiful I am, and I know they’re not saying it just to make me feel better. I take my occasional selfies and feel great about myself for a day or 2. Then, reality hits. 
I’ve always been overweight (not obese) - it’s the truth. I gain weight very easily from a thyroid condition- and my parents have always told me horrible things about how much I weigh or how I look in certain outfits, etc. And- these comments constantly flood my head when I try to put myself out there to date.. 
So that’s what happened with hockey guy, when he told me he wanted to hold me close, my thoughts were
- wow, he’s probably gonna touch my stomach and think I’m fat 
- or he’s going to compare me to his teammates skinny toothpick hockey girlfriends
-how am I going to date such a fit guy like this? 

I’m so fed up with myself. So many opportunities present themselves to me and I deny them because I’m scared to death. I want to feel loved and be loved. I understand that I may have this great personality and pretty face but why can’t I get over what my dad and mom called me in the past? 
If anyone has any sort of advice for me, I’d love that.

fuh3v0,Friends,"I’m not really sure what my thoughts on them are other than it’s seemingly impossible to make them. 

I’m an only child so I never had any siblings to be buddies with and growing up I never really connected with anyone or hung out with them outside of school. As a kid I used to be okay with my life if anything I went out of my way to NOT talk to people I was alone but not lonely that was just how I liked it but now my feelings about my situation have changed and I’m facing the consequences of my past actions.

Now I’m in college and all the people I used to talk to are gone and the closest thing I have to a friend are the people I sit next to that sometimes talk to me during class but now with the semester coming to an end and the whole virus quarantine I don’t even have that anymore. 

And I feel like I really do want to make friends but then when I get the opportunity I either chicken out of it or I start to view it as a chore.

For some reason it’s so much easier to talk online than in person I feel like like my digital persona is so much nicer and easygoing than I actually am. Approaching someone in person is impossible I never can think of what to say once I’m past “hi” and I’m always reminded that most people already have long established friend groups and I feel like I’m intruding something I have no right to.

fuhryr,"Meet your maker, but destroy everything he has made before","Suicide methods are one of two ways. You either have the painless but faulty, or the painful but foolproof. Usually never in between... just check out lostallhope.com. I brainstormed a way that is both painless and foolproof, and it is intricate to say the least. I’m not gonna share it because I’m not gonna have any deaths on my hands, when I see a god (if there is one) I’m gonna need to be as well of with him as possible, considering I just committed suicide.

I DO NOT DESERVE THIS. Why is it that I must be born a loner, be born without any support from friends, and some bitch can just be born with the best amount of charisma possible, and become a celebrity who has an infinite amount of things he/she can fall back onto?

I’ve been kicked, beaten and dragged in the dirt. Both by a member of my own family, and by my peers. Both physically, and emotionally. When I was twelve I got bullied and when I said a simple “stop”, I ended up numerous severe injuries and a short coma.

*If a child is not embraced by his village, he will burn it down to feel its warmth.*

If I go out I wanna go out with a bang. **I do not want to hurt anyone, like I said when I go I want to be on gods good side as much as possible, given the circumstances. Hurting someone will also make me become the very people who put me in this situation, and I refuse to be responsible for someone else ending up just like me.** With that being said, I refuse to go out without some dignity. I want to destroy something, cause some sort of chaos or instability, or steal something. I also want this to be on the highest level possible. I have an idea in mind. I have the skills to do it. It’s just a matter of when.

The Joker was an inspiring movie. Someone stomped on by society like a worm on the sidewalk who ends up rising up to destroy society. Now that is inspiration. It’s fiction, but it’s applied fiction.

Don’t tell me that I need help. I do need help. My dad is rich, both my psychiatrist and therapist are famous around my state. I’ve been seeing them for years, with no progress. For some people, even help cannot help. That is the signal from god that it is time to meet him.

fuhvqf,"Feel stuck, lost, and undeserving","I'm not even sure if I still fit in here these days.  Cause I really thought I'd leave for good.

Times are rough I guess. After all this time, I finally have the social skills to not be called awkward, boring, weird, or quiet. The looks to at least be somewhat average and not completely repulsive to girls. Enough of a social circle, interests, hobbies, and such to not be alone.

Yet at the time, there's really no one I'm close to. I guess it's my own fault, and underlying issues I just don't know how to fix. Whenever I get too close to someone, I seem to just instinctively... Run away? It's not like I'm too anxious to socialize or shy. But when you're close to people, there's just so much more to worry about. Impressing them. Trusting them. Being able to communicate. Having to dedicate time to them. All things I'm perfectly willing and want to do. But it's just scary actually doing it, I guess. I guess I'm just worried about disappointing them. But it's always been something that's been pretty well hidden in the background of most of my connections. It's stronger now than ever. 

I guess to put it simply. I just feel really down right now, due to a multitude of dumb life stresses and internal conflicts. And whenever I feel this way or focus on a problem I'm trying to fix too hard, though I'd love to be my normal, fun, preppy self. My personality always shifts to this emotionally distant, cold, quiet, uncaring, and boring person, that well, pretty much no one in my circles likes, but I can't help it. To make things worse, it's not consistent 😑. So one minute I'm normal, and then next, buzzkill me. So to prevent them seeing that side of me (cause last time I let it show, things just went awful for everyone). I'm just isolating myself. Not talking to anyone at all. But it's really a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

I guess my friends (other than the closest ones who understand) just feel like I'm ignoring them? Or that I don't like them anymore? Like I can feel they're clearly a bit disappointed when I cancel or turn down plans. Or take too long to reply to their messages or leave them on read. But I'm just not in the mental state to interact with them, and they don't get it. If I do, I'll just be... Well, a dick, unknowingly, and I'd rather stop myself before that happens, because then they'd just hate me. But you can only say you need ""space"" for so long until people just forget about you or stop liking you.

Out of the people i'm closest to. I just feel too numb to connect with them. My 2 best friends understand how I am at times, so I'm not too worried about them, though I'd rather get out of this state quick, cause they really are starting to get tired of me always being so distant from them. I had 2 other people I consider best friends, and well, 1 I lost from not restraining my ""dark side"" and we don't talk anymore, which hurts. And the other I distanced myself from for so long that he kind of moved on and we're like strangers now. I had this girl I really loved, but idk if it's just lack of compatibility, and an inability to communicate, meaning we're not right for eachother, or if we just have problems to work out, but it seems with her if I stay too long when I'm down I'll eventually hurt her, but if I distance myself which I'm doing now, from her, I hurt her too, and I just can't get her to understand that I still love her but need space, or maybe I'm just explaining it in the worst way possible. My parents haven't ever really cared about anything about me that's unrelated to health, academics, or work, (2/3 which are going awfully, so I'd rather not talk to them), so I can't go to them either. And well, there's my younger sister. But I care about her too much to let all this baggage drop on her.

I guess I just thought I finally became a normal social person. But deep down, I'm a depressed, impulsive, cold, narcissistic, mess of a person. And though that side doesn't always show. When it does, it hurts everyone around me. And when I distance myself to not show it to people, everyone gets tired of me being so distant from them, move on, and find new people. I just really don't feel deserving of having anyone in my life.

fui4gm,Alone with feelings.,"I would say that's the worst part about being someone that seems to chronically not find people at all or people who take the time to understand you. I've gone through periods of time where I've been completely alone with no one to talk to for months on end. To recent times where I've actually gathered a handful of good friends, which I am very grateful for having because I understand some people don't even have that. But it seems like whenever I try to get very real about myself with them, about problems or thoughts I've had everyday for years. Things that have lead to who I am today. It's seems like they almost never can relate. All I get are stares, and rehearsed responses like what i just opened up about is unfathomable to them. But I know they care about me. Which starts to make me worried that even if I become more sociable and start gathering more ""friends"", I'll always have to live a lie. Burning inside. This Quarantine isn't helping. Even though I'm used to being alone the feeling of being trapped is making a lot of bad memories and feelings resurface. I needed to finally vent.

fui4xw,Anyone else feel like they're too picky?,"I've been browsing all the friendship subreddits for quite a while now, probably on and off for most of the time I've been on Reddit. And yet I still haven't made a friend yet through them. I can count of people I've messaged on both my hands.

Besides skipping the thirsty people and 1 sentence description people, I noticed that I end up reading a post and don't message them or even leave a comment. At most I'll give them an upvote. I can't get the feeling out of my head that I'm being needlessly picky about this. 

I feel like I'm looking for the ""perfect"" friend but that's just not realistic. I doubt people who have friends share 100% of the common interests/hobbies. Yet they still are friends. So why can't I do the same? Why am I looking for a 90-100% match when realistically it'll be around 50% or even less? There's an expectation bar I'm setting which no one is passing.

fuj7nh,The more people I meet the more I realize I'm alone.,"Hello everyone. This is probably going to be a long post mainly because I'm just venting. English is not my main language so my apoligies if this is a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's begin. I have social anxiety, which of course makes almost impossible to meet new people irl. And for some reasons I pushed away my only friends 4 years ago. Since then I've met some random people, but I didn't get close again with anyone. So, for my mental health's sake, I had to look for people on the internet. Meeting people online has been a vicious circle to me: The initial euphoria of meeting someone you get along with, that euphoria slowly fades away and there's no interesting conversations in a couple days. Sometimes I meet someone I like, and, I guess it's mostly because I'm afraid of losing them, I become so clingy and overdependant on that person, so when they dump me I feel like shit.

I'm trying to take a break of social media (mainly apps to meet people, for my own sanity I won't stop scrolling reddit) because it hurts meeting people then watching them slowly getting bored of you.

I also have been blocked by people for absolutely no reason, it makes no sense because we were talking and getting along just fine. It's disheartening.

I'm trying to drop my thoughts here but it seems that I can't write english properly when I'm so tired and depressed.

I expected this to be longer, but I'm so pathetic, I won't find someone who'll stick around without me ruining it sooner or later.

Jeez. Thanks for reading, and I wish you have a good day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuj7nh/the_more_people_i_meet_the_more_i_realize_im_alone/,DioRemTW,1,2020-04-04 08:43:25,5,/r/lonely/comments/fuj7nh/the_more_people_i_meet_the_more_i_realize_im_alone/,NaN

ful3m2,It's been awhile since I posted.,"It's not because I found someone (unfortunately). But because I've been working on myself. Confidence,mental health, appearance, etc. I feel better because I'm putting in the effort, but emotionally. I'm not. I wish I could. It's just this whole virus it seems like is taking over everyone. Made everyone show their true colors. Since my last post here, I've had a old friend of mine treat me like a piece of shit, when I've done nothing wrong. Then, I realized, he's always done this. So I cut any and all ties with him, I decided it was for the best.

I had a small burst of happiness there for awhile. The first girl I had a crush on will be a mother with her first child in November. So that made me delighted. But worried, seeing how the status of the world is hectic as of now, I'm worried in the future this virus will mutate, effect her, the baby, or both and take them and I'd be devastated. But I'm hoping for the best.

Then as of last week. I messaged a old friend from Freshman year (we talked a bit senior year) on how I've been feeling, I felt he'd be the best to talk to about what's been illing my mind and psyche. These included blaming myself for things from the past that are out of my control. Anxiety, depression. And one that may seem silly. But me having the crush on that girl. I basically told her how I felt when she had a boyfriend and I knew. I was just afraid I'd never see her again or tell her or I would act out violently towards others.

Anyways, I'm posting here once more to say, I'm still alone on this Roller Coaster we call Earth. If anybody wants to talk, I'm open to it, but if you may be would like to try and start a little something, I'm open as well.

Peace and Love be with you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/ful3m2/its_been_awhile_since_i_posted/,TheUncagedRage0,1,2020-04-04 10:44:44,2,/r/lonely/comments/ful3m2/its_been_awhile_since_i_posted/,NaN

fulq3f,Post-grad life is very lonely,"Just venting (quarantine is giving me a lot of time to think lol). Any wisdom is appreciated if you’ve been where I am! 

I’ve seen a lot on here that the quarantine is making people aware of how lonely they are. It’s very easy to feel that way with social media, seeing everyone who’s posting their FaceTime hangouts and all the Instagram story tags. It’s hit me the same way. It’s difficult. 

For me, I always had a group of friends to hang out with since elementary school. I was lucky in middle school to connect with a group and always hang out after school at someone’s house and go to a sleepover at least every other weekend. I stuck with most of them throughout high school, meeting new people along the way. I had periods each summer when things quieted down where I worried I didn’t have enough friends, but it went away as soon as I got back to school. By the time I graduated HS, my friend group fizzled out, I had a falling out with one girl as well, and I worried I wouldn’t make any friends in college. I was pleasantly surprised and made a new group of friends when I moved into my dorm. Funny enough, each summer I still worried I didn’t have enough friends. I was sensitive to feeling left out if I saw people doing something without me, but I hid it well. I did a lot of extracurricular things in college, including plays and improv so I always had people to see and hang out with. And then I graduated and life evolved again. 

I don’t talk to any of the people I met in the dorms or from my extracurricular groups. Some have removed me off social media. I have one close friend who I talk to at least once a month, my boyfriend, my family, and that’s it. I miss having people in my life. And the sad thing looking back on all of those times is that I think I was a pretty forgettable person to all of these people. I’ve tried reaching out to some that I miss and used to have wonderful conversations with and it doesn’t seem to refresh anything, so I let it go and try to make peace with the fact that our friendship is not the same anymore and it’s okay that we’ve gone in different directions. But as well as I handle those moments, I’d be lying if I said it didn’t hurt. No one reaches out to me and it reinforces how lonely I feel. I have a problem with social media and comparing myself to others on there, so I have time limits set on my apps so I don’t subject myself to it. At my current job, I don’t connect with any of my coworkers. I don’t really like them as people on top of that, so that whole situation is pretty crummy. I have an urge to change my life once the quarantine ends, but I don’t know how. I just want fresh faces, to make new connections, to build a support system, to feel loved. But considering my track record, I worry I’ll never make lasting friendships. It’s rough. 

Anyway, thank you if you’ve read through all of this. I hope this resonates with someone else and makes them feel less alone in this experience. I’m hoping for change and hoping there are ways I can make this happen that will become clearer ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fulq3f/postgrad_life_is_very_lonely/,throwaway543678910,1,2020-04-04 11:26:57,2,/r/lonely/comments/fulq3f/postgrad_life_is_very_lonely/,NaN

fulyqf,Being Unlikable Sucks,Being lonely sucks. It sucks so much. I'm tired and I just really wish that it wasn't so damn hard for me to find companionship. It's just seems that no matter how hard I try nothing ever develops. It's tearing my already low self confidence to shreds and I don't know what to do about it. It's to the point where I'm even touch deprived and just want to hold (or even be held by) someone. Not in a sexual manner but more in a way that provides comfort and a sense of security that someone truly cares. It doesn't matter what I do to try and be likeable it just ends with the person ghosting me or being told they just don't like me in that manner. Despite my best efforts I have never even had a true relationship in my life and at this point I just feel that I will never be compatible with anyone and that I am not worth people's time and effort.,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fulyqf/being_unlikable_sucks/,RozeyLione,1,2020-04-04 11:44:21,9,/r/lonely/comments/fulyqf/being_unlikable_sucks/,NaN

fuo4ab,"i KNOW you've been through similar experiences, how have you dealt with it?","i'm a 17 year old highschool senior who has a hard time making friendships last and forming meaningful connections.

a little (LONG, beware, it's pretty fucking long) background: for the past 6 years, i've struggled with depression, gnarly defense mechanisms, family issues, and a shitload of other problems that can all be traced back to a few particular points in my childhood. nobody died, i wasn't abused, didn't get into a lot of trouble; around 11 years old, for some reason i started reading, A LOT. i would read fiction, nonfiction, fantasy, horror, sci-fi, everything. i started questioning things, and this is the earliest age i can really recall thinking about things causally and how things ought to be, or even if things ought at all. affected in some way or another by this new thirst for knowledge, i became slightly argumentative - not maliciously but stubbornly curious, sometimes i didn't get the answer i intuitively thought best explained my question. 

unfortunately, this led to more arguments with my parents. instead of just thinking my family simply always knew better, i started to examine their reasoning for punishments, behavior and words instead of using authority as the excuse. in many cases, it didn't check out, i thought ""how can they not see how bad that logic is, how does that justify it!"" it shattered the belief that my parents were totems of knowledge and wisdom, or more accurately knew how to apply their experiences in the most productive ways, like say arguing with a child. eventually, in the aftermath of a really bad argument (being about punishment for ""talking back"" when in reality i simply couldn't grasp how just discussing things over was a bad thing) that resulted in yelling, my dad punching a wall and throwing furniture across the room, and both parents saying and doing things (in tandem towards me) i never thought the people who i live with would ever be capable of saying or doing. the realization of adult immaturity might have ceased my belief in adult superiority, but this argument shattered the belief that the people around me could always understand me or that they wanted to understand me. i remember sitting in the room after both parents left, in shock of what just went down, literally speechless and slowly tearing up. for the first time in my short life i remember i felt a wave of new emotions, some i didn't even know existed. i couldn't understand how anger could someone justify calling their child ""a massive fucking retard who can't shut his fat fucking mouth"" followed by a hole in the wall.

 it didn't make sense. why did they have to say that? why did he have to do that? i momentarily became furious, but suddenly that died down after i realized i would only fall short to the same thing they did, and then i started crying. it wasn't the sort of petulant crying i'd done before like any other kid, but it was a deep, heartwrenching sensation that made it hard to breathe and move. it felt physical, like something had just put their hands around my neck and placed anvil on my chest. the night of, still haven't had said a word to myself or anyone but left in my thoughts,  i felt something i later learned was loneliness. just pure, unbridled loneliness and disconnection. i won't bore this segment on any longer than it already is, but repeats of this sort of situation followed for a few years, and at some point and hardly better than my current situation with my parents, i officially stopped considering my parents as family. i learned family isn't tied by blood, or is wrongly thought so as. i ended up gaining 70lbs through late middle school and early high school, never developed any good friendships, became standoffish and adopted traits found in ASPD. 

since sophomore year to present day, i picked up psychology and philosophy as academic interests and went through a novel phase of viewing myself from a bird's eye view, seeing how problems, both internal and consequential, could be worked on. i'm now short 70lbs, a voracious learner and devil's advocate (shout-out to ENTPs), a competing powerlifter, and more vulnerable (in a good, friendship-beneficial way) than ever. i've worked really hard to transform myself from where i was emotionally. i am genuinely interested in learning more about people. i want to know people on a deep, intimate (but {mainly} platonic) level. not surprisingly, i would for someone to reciprocate in situations like that. and that's what i'm facing now. no one i talk to shares the passion that i do for the topics i enjoy (though admittedly, most people don't like academic philosophy for understandable reasons), or seems to want to form these sorts of connections. i cannot be the only kid who went through some stuff and had beliefs crushed, i know people who've been through significantly worse, but nobody wants to discuss their vulnerable side and what makes them live for tomorrow. i'm always the one initiating conversations, always the one asking to hang out, always the one that wants to know more about the other person. it's fucking isolating. sometimes, i get the idea that most people don't think as clearly or concisely as i do, or connect things as fast as i do and actually do things with those connections like i do, but then someone will tell me that's just me being arrogant. i know it's not arrogance, like how just pointing out you're taller than everyone in a room isn't arrogance, but i just don't like to think like that because it makes me feel even more isolated. i don't know what to do from here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuo4ab/i_know_youve_been_through_similar_experiences_how/,arrogantlyvulnerable,1,2020-04-04 14:31:04,1,/r/lonely/comments/fuo4ab/i_know_youve_been_through_similar_experiences_how/,NaN

fuo5ws,I wish I knew how to feel attachment,"So many people are lonely because of rejection. Or they miss that one somebody. Or perhaps they just don’t have the guts to talk to that *one somebody*. 

But damn. I just don’t know how to feel anymore. I can’t love platonically, much less romantically. 

I am disposable to everyone. I usually befriend the “outcasts”. It’s normally a one way street: They talk of their problems. I help them out. I’m still a mysterious figure to them. If I do share anything personal, it’s usually with no emotion. I just state my burdens stoically, as facts. Once they find their niche, they bid farewell to me for good. No hard feelings. No bad blood. I was just their jumpstart. I have no emotional attachment to them. They still acknowledge me, but it’s nothing more than routine. Then they stop even acknowledging me. 

I so painfully long to feel something about this all. I want to be able to talk candidly about my life. But my reality is far too much for anyone. How can I talk about the weather and sports when depression and ptsd constantly scrape my mind utterly raw? How can I care about what I wear, when I’m working my ass off just to stay afloat and keep my mouth shut? How can I desire any form of intimacy without harboring constant terror of being taken advantage of? Slandered? Attacked? Raped? I don’t know how to fucking love anymore. I can’t. I want to so badly, but the best I can do is indifferent. Indifferent? Is that what someone wants in a friend? My abrasive unlikableness doesn’t help either. Indifferent is as positive as I can feel, but there is plenty worse to be seen. I rarely smile. Not because I’m a *BaD AsS*, but because smiling gets you nothing but motherfucking trauma. Plus, smiling is a pain when you feel nothing of the sort. It kind of disgusts me, when people smile all the time. Even when they’re being an absolute bitch. If you’re gonna be a bitch, be a straight up bitch, no need to be two-faces about it. Oddly enough, usually, the only times I smile outside the confines of my house are when I’m in severe psychological pain. I call it the Overcompensation Station ^TM .

I dream, sometimes, of finding someone (which is the most ridiculously far-fetched thing I’ve ever heard), but those thoughts usually turn sour. I’ve given up on the dream of changing. It’s going on 4 years now. 4 damn years filled with therapy and psychiatrists and medicines and coping skills. And I still want to die. Something is so broken inside me, severed even, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be normal again. “But, coffeenpills, normal is a relative term,” they say. Shut the fuck up. Just stop. I’m in the slimmest percent of so many things. I’ve had a psychiatrist tell me they’ve never met a fucking patient like me before. Another said that I should fix *myself*. I’m the broken of the broken. The outcast of outcasts. The laughing stock of the abused jesters. And I wish I could cease. 

TL;DR: I fucking hate myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuo5ws/i_wish_i_knew_how_to_feel_attachment/,coffeenpills,1,2020-04-04 14:34:47,2,/r/lonely/comments/fuo5ws/i_wish_i_knew_how_to_feel_attachment/,NaN

Now for real. I have no real friends at this point, and I'm in a long-distance relationship that I'm unhappy with (also extra story). I almost constantly just want to be left alone because other people seem to always demean me or act like total morons. But there's also a part of me that wants the classic big group of guy friends (most of my friends throughout my life have been girls) that continue being bros after highschool &amp; college.

And of course I want the old-fashioned wife and kids (crucify me, idc). So I'm confused...

Is anyone else like this? Do you find social interaction often exhausting, but also *yearn* (weird fckn word) for it?

fup4o1,Loneliness After My Ass Got Dumped,"I got broken up with for the first time by the first and only guy I've really ever fallen in love with. It was a complicated relationship, long distance, he was in a different stage of his life, etc. I understand why it didn't last. But I let myself fall in love for some reason and now it's over. One thing I didn't anticipate about being broken up with was how lonely it is. Out of all the people in the world, there is one person who understands the most about what you're going through. A person who understands everything you went through down the path to love and what everything meant to you. And that person is the one person that you can't talk to. It's agonizing. 

About a month after I got broken up with, me and a friend started hooking up, and eventually classified ourselves as friends with benefits. It's kind of perfect because neither of us are ready for a relationship (he also just got out of a relationship), but we've known each other for years and are great friends, and are also highly attracted to one another. That relationship I have with him does a lot for me, and gives me someone I can rely on completely. But there's something missing and I can't stop thinking about it. 

It's the hand reaching out to yours while you're walking, the cute smile that that one person reserves just for you, the knowledge that you're important to someone, and that they think of you and, when they do, that same smile etches onto their face. Random gestures to show that you care, checking in, hugs from the back, kisses on the cheek, binge-watching movies together. It's that romantic, loving side of the relationship. Me and my friend don't have that because we're not in a relationship, we have platonic love and sexual attraction and that's about it. 

But now I've realized that that's the thing that I miss the most. That loving side of a relationship. Don't get me wrong, hooking up is fun, but there's only so much satisfaction it can give you- well, for me at least. 

I think the most messed up part of it all, is that I want that stuff so much, but anytime anyone shows that they may offer that to me, I back out. Because I'm afraid to have my heart broken again, for someone to walk away again, because I know that they will. I can never have that little loveable part of a relationship again because I don't want to get a taste of paradise only to be left on the side of the road again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fup4o1/loneliness_after_my_ass_got_dumped/,bae__blade,1,2020-04-04 16:02:27,2,/r/lonely/comments/fup4o1/loneliness_after_my_ass_got_dumped/,NaN

fupqti,My heart is in pain from the loneliness,"I don't know why I am posting this, I just, need to get it out. 

I've been lonely forever. I've never had a family that was there for me - in a massive family, I was always treated as not human and isolated. I crave having someone that loves me for who I am, unconditionally, and I've never had that.

I know, most families have problems. But most families go through ups and downs and they still have memories of happiness with their families. Maybe not always, but just at some times. But I don't even have 1 memory of happiness. It's either abuse, or doing absolutely nothing. I was denied ALL happiness as a child. I lived in the Middle East for most of it and every family member likes to remind me how bad I had it. 

They treated me differently than everyone else, abused and neglected me to an extent that no one else experienced. I felt alone and I just wanted someone to love me. I was always told the most horrible things and I have far too many stories of abuse. The only people that loved me all died... my brother died when he was 14 and it killed me. I'm still not over his murder. I miss him so much. 

-

I don't want to be gay. I hate the feeling so much. But I don't think it's my fault. I know that children who have been abused typically turn out gay and hopefully that's the reason. But it makes me physically sick to even think about being gay. 

I don't even have any friends. I've only really made 1 real friend in my life and (because I'm gay) kinda liked her for more than a friend, which was just painful. Then she moved away, which just broke my heart. 

The only person I actually trust is a teacher and that's just depressing. The school holidays (it's holidays in Australia) is the most painful time because I can't talk to him about it. 

My family are really Middle Eastern - unlike me, who has left Islam and Westernized, I like to read books instead of yell about the Quran - and they don't let me leave the house apart from going to school. 

I'm generally someone who doesn't have emotions, but now I'm experiencing a level of depression and anxiety that I have never experienced before. I also have really bad flashbacks at night and I can't sleep.

TLDR; My childhood was FULL of abuse and neglect, I was never permitted a day of happiness, my family hates me, I don't have any friends, I am gay and it breaks my heart... and the only person I trust is my teacher.

fuq16t,No matter how hard I try...,"My name is Ryan. I’m 21, and feel the loneliest I’ve ever felt before. It seems like no matter how hard I try to reach out and communicate with people who I think care about me, I’m wrong. My heart is broken because my best friend of five years just told me I stress her out and raise her anxiety level the other day. Just out of the blue. When I though that I was being a good friend, doing my best to show her I care and value her just to hear that out of nowhere.

In college, it’s like I’ve made acquaintances. People who I thought cared about me, have invited me to their houses and hung out with me off campus, just for them to fade away. Over the summer, I hadn’t heard from a single one of them. When the fall semester picked up it was like “I was gonna text you but...”, then whatever seemed to fit the sentence at the time. Recently I’ve had another friend of six years just cut me off for nothing. No reason at all. 

I’m starting to feel like giving up on everything completely. I keep trying with people everyday but I just can’t seem to reach anybody. I feel the walls around me shrinking by the minute. This loneliness is starting to really effect me mentally to the point where I wake up every morning feeling like someone else could’ve made a better use of life than me. I’m always doing the best I can, trying to talk to people the best way I’d want to be spoken to. I can’t remember the last time someone just asked me, “how are you”? These antidepressants and anxiety meds seem to keep me just from the edge of ending it all. 

I apologize for the long text. I figured maybe one of you in here would care. Being alone is so crippling and it truly sucks. Being surrounded by all these people, family members, and still managing to feel absolutely isolated and alone. It just sucks sometimes. It really does. Anyway, I hope you’re all doing okay during these times, if you ever feel how I do, I’m here for you all. Strangers or not.

furwjh,I feel defeated...,"I guess I’m writing this out of despair. The last year has not been the easiest for me, and I developed social anxiety.... I’m tired of being told that there’s many people around me who value me, I know that, but I just feel like they only care when it’s convenient. Also  is it normal to feel so lonely even if you have many friends? 

I feel I just can’t connect with anybody. I try my best to meet new people, and we get along, we start texting each other and just like that, whatever interest they had in me vanishes, leaving an emptiness in me I can never fill. 

I guess I’m also jealous, I don’t know how people can have many friends who care about them, and care about their feelings, I don’t know what it feels like to be a priority to someone, I can’t remember when was the last time I hugged somebody, and it hurts, it hurts so bad to stay so strong all the time. It hurts to know I can’t trust my “friends” because they don’t even hear me or try to understand that I have feelings too. 

I know I’m not the most expressive, and I take too long to trust people, but I just feel like I’m always interested in other people, whilst nobody ever takes an interest on me; I feel like my anxiety pushes them away and I can’t help it, I can’t help it, and I just watch them leave or find someone else. I don’t know how to make people stay and it’s killing me inside.   

I don’t know what to do, I have felt lonely for more than a year and I can feel envy growing in my heart because other people have what I can’t have so easily. And don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for them, and that’s amazing, but why can’t anybody love me that same way? What makes other people more special than me? I don’t know, I don’t know what I should fix about myself, and I just keep craving something that never comes. 

I’m sorry.. it’s my first post too... I just can’t hold it anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/furwjh/i_feel_defeated/,a7xvalentine,1,2020-04-04 20:08:38,3,/r/lonely/comments/furwjh/i_feel_defeated/,NaN
fuscp3,I want to be alone,"These days I'm starting to believe that I want to feel as lonley as possible. I don't want people to care about me at all. I want them to see me just as a human being who's going about his own way. I think I'm losing/have lost the ability to care for people/love people. And even more, others care for me feels like a burden on me to perform better and not feel like shit all the time. They don't deserve to be around a person like me who can't appreciate others. I hate myself so others care for me seems misplaced. I want to be as lonely as possible. An ideal situation would be if people just forget all memories of me. Then I could continue living my miserable life but at least I won't be a burden to others.

futudr,[m] Can’t even be bothered trying to socialise.,"My social life is almost completely nonexistent. I get along with a few people well at work, but have no contact outside of it whatsoever. I’ve only just left school but already stopped talking to most of my friends, who are living in another state completely cut off from me now the borders are closed. I live with my dad and stepmother, and all my siblings are having a great time in quarantine together without me.

I’ve always looked forward to being in a relationship, but being slightly overweight (and I mean very slightly, according to recommended BMI) I don’t think any of them have found me attractive enough compared to my other friends. I’m very caring by nature, and often back myself into that ‘support friend’ position (sorta like a friendzone, but worse since they only ever talk to you when they need help). 

My friends were heaps of fun, but none of them are very supportive and I found myself falling behind as I kept feeling emptied and emptier. Several times throughout the year I would have almost no contact with them at school and spend my breaks and free’s in the music rooms alone. 

Now I can’t even bring myself to make new friends or try dating. I hug a pillow at night to feel less alone 😂.

fuv668,A Life of Pushing Away,"So recently, within the past year or so, figured out why I have tried but always pushed away from relationships . I am an old man who has had some wonderful opportunities for some what could have been well fantastic dreams but always had deep trust issues and backed away . Even as an educated guy and knowing at some point inside me there was a problem. Now as a senior as far as numbers go , alone and really afraid of a loveless life . Well through reading and self research figured out that an incident of attempted abuse by a trusted neighbor and early teen stupid relationship breaks well all culminate in a life of looking ok on the outside having some real issues .  To be honest ,  I recently attended a funeral for a girl I grew up with sad enough, but ran into her brother and snapped , beating the guy pretty good and breaking down. They had a big family and his older brother finally got hold of me, we talked alone and he kind of suspected the reasons. After a lifetime apart from childhood relationships . Story got deeper as I learned  from the oldest and the one I attacked left the funeral pretty quick and I learned he was a registered offender which included his own children.  Thinking about it many there were not surprised or offended , even though I did not really stick around. Adding to my issues I recently had a social media request from my first real love into high school years. Blast from the past but a deep cut still, seems all happy lets talk , bla bla bla. Small town life mutual friends telling me she was acquainted with another woman who knows me. Wow it is a lady from college years that I was very close to but actually pulled my life long pull back from just before it got real serious. Again all me and trust issues. The primary forgetting I caught her cheating on me with my friend or so I thought , with a guy a few years older who was my mentor and coach in a sport I was pretty god at. I was always the nice guy and just backed off even though in a few future years a friend who had a baby with her asked me if I was involved with her. I never said anything but knew who may have been the guy getting in on the lady. Always just shutting up.  So now I am alone in life and maybe figured out how my youth and life of trust issues  has cost me or caused me to do what I did many times. I don't feel better only alone in a world where I see beauty in woman of all ages , and live life alone in all aspects, not close to anyone without a feeling for purpose or motivation. Just trying to keep on going and dreaming of a woman .",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuv668/a_life_of_pushing_away/,Riverside63,1,2020-04-05 00:04:38,0,/r/lonely/comments/fuv668/a_life_of_pushing_away/,NaN

fuvw7o,My experience with r/MeetPeople [Rant],"Before I begin, I would like to say I know my problems are nothing compared to that of those suffering out in the “real world”. Furthermore, I know that I do not personally know what the people I’m meeting are going through and talking to some stranger online probs won’t be their priority. With that out the way, to those on that subreddit:

Can anyone actually start conversations? Why do I always have to try and keep asking questions, keep the conversation moving? I get it, I ain’t the most interesting person but most of your fucking posts say you want to talk, you want a friend but nobody seems to give a damn. Talking to about 20 people around my age of opposite gender, nobody bothers to initiate anything, sure you can be shy or introverted but I am too! They say that they are lonely, that they want to talk someone. So fucking talk. Sure if the convo goes stale it can end, not every person I talk to will or should be perfect. But at least put some effort, some effort to fucking... i dunno (what’s the name of the sub reddit?) oh yeah, MEET PEOPLE! 

With all that done, maybe it’s me, I mean partly (cause I still am pissed that nobody gives a shit about me) I mean I’m working on myself. I exercise, I try to eat healthy. But no, my personalities shit and the fact nobody gonna accept me (bar of course a few changes for the better). 

Man I just want some female friends, I mean I’m not being intrusive, I don’t ask anybody for anything lewd or about where they live. I don’t even trick myself into thinking that I like them romantically. I’m just being myself and trying to talk. I can take blame if you find me uninteresting but if you won’t even take the chance or put effort into knowing me, then what’s the point?",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuvw7o/my_experience_with_rmeetpeople_rant/,AnAddictedFifaPlayer,1,2020-04-05 00:48:27,7,/r/lonely/comments/fuvw7o/my_experience_with_rmeetpeople_rant/,NaN

fuwew5,I'm so lost. Can someone who has been through this offer some insight?,"I'll try to keep the long story short.
Basically, I (19M) don't have a perfect family life and had never been in love (excluding childhood times). My parents divorced when I was small and I had to tough up and become the center of the family, taking care of my younger brother, do house work and try to manage every interaction by preventing arguments from happening. As a result, I've gotten very used to not telling my family anything, even when I'm really sad and just want some affection I would simply hide my desires and act like the mature and tough son I was. As a result, I've never had a relationship where I can freely express my feelings towards the opposite person. I have really good friends, but they all have their family and partners (yes I'm the only one of all my close friends to have never dated), but as I am not their first priority I always felt a reluctance in reaching out to them too often, just so I don't bother their relationships too much. This is pretty much my back story summarized.

Now, I'm 19 and the aforementioned events happened 10 years ago. Between the 10 years nothing much happened to me, except meeting a bad friend who further destroyed my self worth. 
I'm now a person who laughs a lot on the outside, with people describing me as the most ""optimistic person ever"" or the ""happiest guy ever"". While I am in fact an optimistic person when it comes to life and career, I get really pessimistic when it comes to relationships.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuwew5/im_so_lost_can_someone_who_has_been_through_this/,boiledwagyu,1,2020-04-05 01:18:48,5,/r/lonely/comments/fuwew5/im_so_lost_can_someone_who_has_been_through_this/,NaN

fuxgnp,Sick of being put in a bubble,"I've never done this before so please bear with me.... This post will be long winded but I truly want to try to see if anyone else has felt the same way. To sum it up, I had a very tumultuous childhood; my dad was an angry and loud alcoholic who was very distant and made me feel inadequate for most of my childhood. I was frequently yelled at over mundane things, told that he wished he never had kids, and made to feel pretty uncomfortable constantly. In no way do I hate my parents for my childhood. My dad has faults yes, but his own father was very abusive and also an alcoholic and his mother abandoned him and his younger brother when my dad was only 13. So, I understand his hurt and his own trauma he experienced. Same with my mom, she was a young mom, she was scared and she was told by her parents that divorce isn't an option. I just have so many memories walking in on my mom crying on her bathroom floor because my dad had gone on a bender. It was sad to be forced to have conversations with your mother at 6 about how daddy is drunk again and to go to my room and lock the door.

Also, I had an older brother who tried his best to shelter me from the yelling and chaos in my household and I'm so grateful for that. However, when he turned 13, he got into the wrong crowds and subsequently became very aggressive, involved in drugs and forced me to help in criminal activities even though I didn't want to. So from the ages of 9 to about 16 my life consisted of a lot yelling at home, being forced to help my brother sneak in and out of the house, and also trying to ensure my mom was strong enough to stay around. I ate pretty much every single one of my meals as a kid completely alone. We didn't eat as a family, we didn't have family game nights, we all just pretty much co-existed and then arguments would happen. Due to my brother being years older than me, he grew fed up with my dad's behaviour and would step in when he'd yell at me, or my mom and my brother and father came to blows many times. I witnessed countless physical fights, had to break some up, and would just spend hours locked in my room trying to cope with my home life. I felt like I could never be comfortable around my own family and so I became a very guarded person. A lot of people that meet me tell me they think that I'm ""cold"", ""distant"" or ""difficult to speak to"". In reality, I just put up huge barriers with people because I've been hurt so many times by my own family I can't take more rejection. It's not a good coping method but unfortunately this seems to be how I've dealt with my trauma. I just don't know how to stop being this way. I can't make friends because it takes me too long to open up.

Anyways, the point of this post is, I just want to know, am I capable of being normal? 

Due to such a tumultuous childhood, I withdrew more and more into myself as I aged. I have struggled so much over the years as I've aged and had to deal with the usual teen drinking. I have such a hatred towards drinking and personally do not like it. When I feel myself feeling drunk I get panic attacks. I'm sure it's because of my childhood, but a lot of people over the years have thought I was a bitch or lame because I just never wanted to get drunk. I never judge those who do, I'd honestly just rather not get drunk myself. I'm happy to honestly just be around people who are happy because of how little happiness I saw in my own house growing up. Because of people thinking I'm just being ""judgey"", I haven't had a lot of friends. I accept I've had an interesting childhood, and because of that, I just want to feel loved and accepted, but most friends I have don't wanna be my friend because they think I'm a judgemental person. And then I don't want to be honest with people about my childhood because they might pity me. In reality, I just had to grow up really young and so I might seem boring to most. 

I just honestly want to not feel alone anymore. I feel like I was cheated of having a normal life and I feel so sad sometimes. I know I deserve to be loved but I never really have and I'm 23....

fuxo4g,"So I guess this is gonna be a mix of rant and my story? Probably gonna be a train wreck, sorry","Apologize in advance for my english, it’s not my native language. So, I had a full time nanny (live in) ever since I was born, wasn’t and isn’t really close with my parents. (I care about them, but our relationship is kind of formal, if that make sense?) anyway, as a kid my parents were busy workaholic and my mother was also taking care of my grandparents in the hospital so I was very dependent on my nanny, physically and emotionally. Also, my mom and dad fought a lot, my dad hit my mom at times, and he always made us watch. Literally he called all of us (the kids) to go into the living/dining room before actually start fighting. Than I would cry, and he gets upset when we cry, and my nanny would console me afterward. Anyway, just saying that bc as a teenager I used to blame that for my lack of socializing skill? But my siblings are all social butterflies so probably it’s not the case and im just making excuses rip. 
Anyway, I was that quite, polite kid during kindergarten and elementary school. The kind teachers would describe “a dream to have in class” or something like that. My fondest of memory was 4th grade in elementary school, I think that was when I got my first taste of close friendships. We drifted apart after starting junior high school though, unfortunately (we went to different school). I was in one junior high school for one semester but transferred. I already made a friend at the time, so I was a bit upset about transferring. The first semester in my new school, I wasn’t able to make any friends. I made friends in 8th grade, unfortunately we were scrambled into different classes for the ninth grade, and I didn’t quiet fit in with my 9th grade class. Anyway, I am rather funny with my friends, but if I don’t have anyone, I am back to being that quite, polite, boring, recluse kid. Anyway, in those friendships (4th and 8th grade, it was like, in a group, like 5-6 people and I am grateful for them and though I would like to think we were quite close as a group, I didn’t feel personal connection with any of them if im being honest) 
Anyway, I entered senior high school after that. The memory is still quiet fresh as I only graduated last year. I remember I made it a goal to be more outgoing and hopefully give off more fun, approachable vibe. Not being able to fit in/make friends have always been a fear of mine since elementary school, so I was scared about this as well. My 10th grade class was awesome. I like the whole class but I also had a group of friends. But yeah, the class was awesome, one time the whole class just skipped a class together (except for like, 4 people) and we were scolded together. There were times when like almost 3/4 of the class (like around 20 people) go into one of us house after we went swimming together, and we were working hard together for the art and sport festival. However, they scramble the class in second semester, based on our grade n the first semester. The thing is, I was put into a different class than everyone in my friend group (literally all of them was put into one class! What are the chances?) anyway, I was put into the, idk what you call it in english, but basically if you are put in that class you can finish high school early. I don’t think I can handle the pressure and with permission from my mom, made formal request to be moved to regular class. I was hoping I can get into my group of friend’s class, but unfortunately I was put in a different class. I talked to them still, but obviously with them being in one class and im the only one in different class, they are naturally closer together. But the group chat was popping tho. Anyway, I struggled a bit friend wise in my new class. 2.5 years I was there, it seems like I moved between groups several times. Also, and I don’t mean to brag here, but like, everyone in my year know me, it always happen, from elementary school. I think it’s because my family is upper middle? I honestly don’t know how they know because I never brag and I look so fucking plain. Anyway it’s that situation when everyone know me and my name, some of them say hello in passing but that’s it. Anyway, this one stings. So I was in 12th grade, my birthday was coming, as per tradition, I was going to treat my friend (here it’s tradition for the birthday girl/boy to treat her or his friends, I heard it’s the other way around in some places?) anyway, we already set the date but my mom was asking me to accompany her going to a party she’s invite to, my siblings weren’t able to accompany her. I didn’t want her to go alone so I apologized to my friends (my friend group from 10th grade) and ask wether we can postpone/change the date. Admittedly it was a bit sudden (2 days before the day we were supposed to meet up) but my mom only told me that day. The party was in a city about 45 minutes drive from my city. My family has a house there, so I also gave my friends the option for them to stay there while I accompany my mom to the party and I’ll get back to the house and we can figure out what to do from there. But they never replied to me after that. I was like, okay, they are mad, but I thought it would last maybe 3 days tops. Well, weeks passed, graduation day came, and they still ignored me, didn’t acknowledge me on graduation. Made a new group chat. Not gonna lie I was sad about it, before they became angry at me the group chat was popping, shitposting, memes, whatever. Anyway, in my country there’s this program where you can go to public uni without test if your grade continually improve every semester in high school. It’s very selective though, slight decline and you are out. It also depends on the quota of the course/faculty of your choosing. Each year less than 20% of students can go via this program. I remember when I started high school my mom said I have to be diligent so I can go to uni via this program and I worked hard and I was already accepted but than my parents were like... actually you should study oversea instead since your sister is already there. So my hardwork went down the drain lmao. But anyway, I had to wait a few months until I go to that country (I can go for july intake (graduated in may) but it just felt too sudden for me so I chose the march intake the next year) anyway those long months without having any frend to talk to or meet was... boring and lonely. I pretended that I have friends to my family bc I don’t want to be seem like a loser (as I told you, my siblings are all social butterflies) so sometimes I would go out somewhere alone but tell my family im meeting my friends. Anyway, I decided to use my time to volunteer in a rural, underprivileged village quite far away from my country (1 hour by plane), 4.5 hours drive from the airport to the village. At first my parents were against it bu I was like lmao yall gonna send me on my own to another country but won’t let me travel within my own country? And eventually they let me. It was a fullfilling experience and I am grateful, but anyway I went back home after 2 months and felt lonely again. Than it was time to go to that country. I remember feeling sad bc I literally don’t have to say goodbye to anyone other than my family. Kinda wanna tell about my experience here in this country so far (where I am studying in) but I think this post is already super long so I apologize for that. But yeah, anyway, in my entire life I don’t think I ever had a close friend and I just long for that kind of connection",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuxo4g/so_i_guess_this_is_gonna_be_a_mix_of_rant_and_my/,oddly-,1,2020-04-05 02:30:55,0,/r/lonely/comments/fuxo4g/so_i_guess_this_is_gonna_be_a_mix_of_rant_and_my/,NaN

fuxvd2,"I feel so trapped, can't do anything about my loneliness.","I haven't had any friends for 5 years, not a single one. All of my free time for 5 years I have spent without any friends. The loneliness sucks, and I feel so trapped because I have tried seemingly everything to make friends but nothing works. Most people dislike me after just seeing how I look. 

At least when there wasn't this pandemic, I would go to nightclubs alone just to be around other people and have fun. Not being around or interacting with other people for too long creates this almost claustrophobic feeling in me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuxvd2/i_feel_so_trapped_cant_do_anything_about_my/,HasNoFriendz,2,2020-04-05 02:42:13,1,/r/lonely/comments/fuxvd2/i_feel_so_trapped_cant_do_anything_about_my/,NaN
fuxy0z,It apparent that I'm not worth anything to anyone.,"This week, I had someone that I've been there to support when nobody else would pretty much tell me that she is more important than I am.
This happens pretty often with her. She gets a new job or some shit after being allowed to do nothing for a period of time and begins to go on power trips. The only one she attacks is me.
Between being an amputee that is denied disability and being unable to find steady work or even friends, I deal with enough bull crap on a daily basis, now I have to endure this.
My brother overheard everything she said and claims that it pissed him off but he doesn't want to say or do anything because he doesn't want to start a fight which has caused me to feel like its a them vs me kind of situation.
That's how it always goes. No matter how often she does this shit. 
I'm now isolating myself and really only come out of my room when I know I can avoid speaking to anyone. 
I don't want to be around her or unfortunately, anyone that condones and stays silent about it, or has anything to do with her but I can't move or anything.
I feel like once this Covid thing is over, I'm just going to sell my belongings and wander the streets until I run out of money and die just so that I never have to speak to or look at any of these people again. 

It won't teach anyone anything or open up anyone's eyes but it'll make ME feel better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuxy0z/it_apparent_that_im_not_worth_anything_to_anyone/,JohnbieCT,1,2020-04-05 02:46:34,3,/r/lonely/comments/fuxy0z/it_apparent_that_im_not_worth_anything_to_anyone/,NaN
fuy0mt,Goodbye to you all (even tho this won’t be seen or read by anyone),"To the entire W family, I hope you all will be able to move on as usual. I never really had a connection with any of you. Interaction with you all, came across to seem as if you all have bitter and resentful feelings towards me, even though I don’t feel that way about any of you.

To my immediate family, this will probably end up impacting you two the most out of everyone. You two are most likely going to be the only ones who’s aware of my exiting. I’m sorry to my brother and my mother, I can’t live just for the sake of family, when the world that’s not related to me doesn’t want anything to do with me.

To my last few friends 
B, G, N, N, E, C, C
Thank you for bringing joyful moments in my life.  I’m glad that none of you will be impacted by my exiting, never knowing due to having no one to inform anyone of you. None of you have contact with my family, the only people who’d be aware. Due to none of my friends and the majority of the younger generation not reading the newspaper, there won’t be a source to inform of my passing. I hope you all can proceed as usual like nothing happened. I will leave this world without others being aware of it. To both N &amp; C, I hope your guys wedding goes well, as well with you N, I hope your wedding with M goes well. 

Z,J,M,P. I’m sorry for letting you all down and I’m heartbroken I ended up getting all four of you to not want anything to do with me and not being able to bear a conversation with me. It wasn’t any of your faults for my depressed/suicidal condition of 2019 that was caused by work, school and finances. However I bottled it up and isolated myself instead of informing anyone of you of struggling even though you were the uplifting highlight of my days. I became too draining for you guys and I’m not upset with anyone of you four for walking away, I wish I could say otherwise for how I feel about myself however. Even though the four of you seem to borderline despise me and would flee the room if I was present, I still care about you guys. In my final moments and as my heart beats for the last time, I’ll be thinking of the positive memories. You guys will think of me on however you choose to think about me, I can’t change if you guys perceive my exiting as a pathetic attempt at attention in the near 0% chance any of you will be informed of my absence. I just want to  rest and end this pain which has had no minimization from medicine, hospitalization, or therapy.

With friends dwindling, living back home, financially struggling, college degree field being shut down from budget cuts. I’m left with nothing but loneliness and emptiness. Such emotional agony that causes me physical aches and pain alongside emotional. Personal hobbies are pointless when it’s constantly while alone and there’s no one to share or talk about said hobby with. 

The last loved one in my life to mention is someone who isn’t capable of reading this and that’s my dog. I love you R and it might be tough being in a new home, with me being your second home and owner. I hope you get people that’ll love you as much as I loved you and that aren’t as broken as me. Thank you for keeping me company in my last months here when others couldn’t stand my presence.

I told myself if by April things had worsened then it’ll be time to end it all and it has and it’ll clearly continue for the rest of my life. Some people aren’t meant for this world and that’s something I’ve come to terms with. I’m not scared of being gone, I’m finally ready to end my worthless misery. I just have to wait until the house is inevitably empty to make sure there isn’t anyone to stop my passing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fuy0mt/goodbye_to_you_all_even_tho_this_wont_be_seen_or/,agenericaccount12345,2,2020-04-05 02:50:42,6,/r/lonely/comments/fuy0mt/goodbye_to_you_all_even_tho_this_wont_be_seen_or/,NaN

fuyjgl,Lonely and bored out of my mind,"So i used to live like this for a long time, only sitting indoors and going to the gym, never really interacting with anyone besides for small talk in the sauna. I did this for many years, but i was kinda ok with it, it wasn't that bad. But when i joined Judo and started taking courses on certain things, and now when i can't do that at all i feel that going back to what i used to do being solitary, i can't really go back to it for some reason despite doing it for years. I miss the physical contact and exhilaration of doing judo, and talking while waiting in queue, or talking with other people on courses, even though they are all like 50 years older than me. 

I made some textures today to try to be productive, i kinda gave up after an hour because i couldn't get the pants right, and then i saved it as xcf for future work. It feels so hollow. No new games to look forward to besides Elden Ring, but it'll most likely come out next year which is a long time. I do some knitting and drawing but it's not exhilarating adrenaline fun that is Judo or doing military press PR's.

fuyjum,Stuck in my room under self-isolation and it really sucks being alone,"Hello everyone, hope you're well.  


Unfortunately I've been sick for almost two weeks now and developed pneumonia, I was told by my doctors I didn't have pneumonia, apparently they had someone else read my x-rays and I do. I can't get tested but was told there's a pretty big chance I have coronavirus.   


I had isolated from my family for about 6 days until I felt better because I just assumed I had the flu. My doctor told me I need to isolate, again, for another 7 days. I'm already a pretty lonely person but as long as I could do stuff with my mom it was tolerable. Now I can't see anyone in my house or put them further at risk.   


I have some (two, lol) friends online I talk to but I can't do anything like voice chat because my voice is shot from coughing and talking makes me cough more. I feel so damn alone. I miss my parents, I miss my dogs.   


I thought about making some new friends online, but I suck at making friends and always end up ghosting most people anyway. I want friends, but I don't want friends..if that's possible.

fuyz3r,First time posting here...,"Umm I don't know how this goes but I feel like I want to remove something off my chest maybe it'll make the drowning sensation a bit bearable. I suffer from depression and anxiety, been feeling suicidal, more than usual, so I thought since Reddit suggested this sub to me might as well give it a try.

I'm 19 and I don't know how to convey emotion like everyone else on here, as a guy I wasn't taught how to express certain things, and so I bottled up everything since I was born... so I took on art to express words that I find hard to utter to another person, so i hope maybe this poem will make sense of what I feel inside...

Title: Hidden Truth

1.The thoughts keep on being persistent

2.The unease increases

3.The voices violently strident

4.The inability to keep calm on my arm i reenact the crucifixion of Jesus 


5.They don't seem to quiet down

6.I don't hear the soft voice that carries authority

7.So i lay in bed, use my burdens as a night gown

8.You never know when you'll need to switch personality 


9.Lie to the faces that claim they care

10.Laugh at those who claim do not

11.Know its just your reflection, you stare

12.Spiraling into an episode of self loathe, you are caught

fv2wdk,Gave this person my heart,"Gave this person my heart. Came into my life after a break up, told me she was completely done with him. 3 months of hanging every weekend (something im not accustomed to but I enjoyed it and spending time with her) and her spending the night at my place multiple times, to meeting my parents... to all just be shit on in a couple texts when I told her how I didn’t really know how she felt about me DESPITE wanting to hang all the time, spend the night, be intimate, meet my parents, etc. 

So I finally asked her if I was just a rebound or not. Was told she “fucking misses her ex. Misses her amazing relationship and the the amazing two years she had and that she’s still healing.” She told me she was grateful that I have been there to lean on. But assured me I wasn’t a rebound. Could never give a solid answer about how she felt and the most I got was “just know my feelings aren’t as strong.”

I haven’t had a girlfriend in 7 years. This is the closest thing I’ve had to something “serious” in the last half decade. But I feel like I need to just give up at this point. Since our conversation where she shit on me and told me about how she’s really still not over her ex, she’s acted completely different. Responds way late. Doesn’t make plans to hang (not that we really even can, but maybe like a zoom hang or even getting food real fast). Things are completely different rn. 


I just feel lost. Stupid for caring about someone more than they care about me. Silly for thinking I might have something real. Angry because I feel as though I really was just a rebound. And lonely af because with out this,  I have absolutely nothing. I’m in quarantine. I can’t go try to distract myself or go meet new people or even just flirt with a cashier to get her off my mind or something.

fv3dn9,Feeling down,"Recently it just gets to the same point in the night when I just feel lonely and down. I am 18 and all my friends from primary school and secondary school stopped talking to me. And now my friends from college have as well. In school I always had friends around me. I always had people there who cared about me. Now everyone is gone. My girlfriend of 2 years never asks how I am. Never puts effort into conversation and always show that she (maybe jokingly) doesn’t like things about me. If I try talk to her about how it makes me feel she blames it on her depression and insecurities. I love her with all of my heart which makes it so hard. She tells me it’s “gay” Becuase I like self hygiene products like lip balms and moisturiser. Apparently I’m an “old man” Becuase I enjoy nature and the weather and things like that. I guess I just miss feeling like people care about me. I miss feeling like a person. Now I just feel like an animal in a cage. I don’t want to break up with her I just wish she realised how much I care about her. And I wish she would show me how much she claims she cares about me. My friends I have given up on and just accepted that people don’t want to stick around for me. I miss having people there for me every day to make me laugh and ask me how I am. To cheer me up when I’m down and to just be there. I’m just a ghost. I dont think anyone cares. I removed most people off my Instagram to see who would care enough about me to notice and add me back. Not a single person did.

fv3kf4,Being in quarantine has made me realize how lonely I really am.,"As we speak I am trying to hold back tears. I am on the verge of a panic attack. I can feel it. 

I have been in quarantine going on 4 weeks. The first couple weeks I was okay because I was staying active. But the lack of motivation has consumed me. It has left me with a lot of time to think about things, mainly how lonely I really am. 

I would say that in my normal life, a few really good friends. Everyone else are just acquaintances. I have tried many times to make friends online, putting myself out there just to get ghosted. It just so hard when people don’t really want to put in as much effort as you or the conversation just fizzles out. 

I just wish I had one person that could make me feel less lonely. Loneliness is one of the worst feelings a person can experience.

fv40ix,Late night rambles,"Heard Reddit is a good place to post your thoughts anonymously for a while now, so have a late night vent I wrote on diphenhydramine. Things have been off lately, this quarantine is driving me nuts and I’m so..alone, and I can’t learn to be comfortable in it

I wanted to talk to you again tonight. I miss you so much and how close we used to be, both physically and emotionally. We used to tell each other everything, now I don’t even know how your day was..I long for you in the bed, next to me, chuckling about some random memory of some person I don’t know, holding me in the dimly lit room we used to share..I feel so out of place and off these days, like a piece of me is missing, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think you’re the piece missing, but I feel like there’s someone I’m meant to be with, that I was with in another life that my soul is searching for, yearning for so much..I’ve been talking to God a lot lately, I always tell Him to look out for you, to make sure you know you’re loved, and that I think about you always, even if you find me clingy and odd. I don’t think anyone knows as much as you do, or could quiet my head the way you did, but I hope you find someone else who feels that way. I know you talk to me just to keep things good between us..you always hated tension with someone or bad “vibes”, but every time you text it makes my day, and breaks my heart realizing that’s how it is now. I can’t sleep without the aid of some drug, and even then I wake up constantly throughout the night, vivid dreams of past friends and lovers haunting me, taunting me with everything I ruined and still hope to regain some day. Maybe I do have a victim mentality, thinking that way, but I don’t feel like a victim, I just feel lonely and confused, like a child lost in a grocery store, knowing my loved ones are out there, but where? Then the panic sets in, the sadness, the wondering of what will happen next and how long will it be before I find them...I’m so happy that you’re happy now, moving on and growing, I think I’m growing too, but I wanted to grow with someone, instead I’m growing alone, slowly, painfully...I thought getting back to work would fix everything, but I still feel empty, not depressed, but distant, gone, constantly in a fog of fake smiling and banter, wishing, hoping someone will see past it and offer to take me out and talk about everything we’ve messed up on, bonding over our shared mistakes. I hate sleeping alone, I hate being alone, I hate not having someone else’s scent and touch to comfort me, someone to kiss my head and tell me I’m wanted and loved..I feel so petty, small, out of place lately..if a job didn’t fix this feeling, when will it leave? Will it take someone else to touch the parts of me I hate for me to finally move on from you? I’m trying so hard, but I have no idea what I’m working toward...I thank god for waking me up everyday, and keeping me safe until I go to bed each night, but I beg him for someone to cherish and love unconditionally, someone I don’t feel like I’m annoying everytime I approach them...someone who cherishes and loves me unconditionally, only me, too. I have to learn to love me, but I don’t know how, I’ve done so many bad things, made so many poor choices, had so many awful thoughts and terrible desires, and my skin never feels like my own..what is next for me? What will all of this confusion and loneliness lead into, and will it be as beautiful as what we had, and will I be ungrateful, not learn my lesson, and destroy that too? Can people see the hate I harbor for myself and that’s why they keep leaving? Is god really all I need to fill this hole? I know nothing..everything is open for debate, but I have no side to support, caught in the middle. Come back to me.

fv4b74,I hope everyone here is doing okay.,"I've been sending out texts to people I consider (considered, I guess?) friends, just checking up on them, asking if they're okay, seeing how they're doing/feeling, offering to get groceries for those who are unemployed, trying to arrange zoom or FaceTime ""happy hours"" that everyone is doing. And based on the (very little) responses I've been getting, it really doesn't seem like anyone cares. I doubt anyone would have checked up on me if the situations were reversed. I'm not the type of person to fault people for that, though. Everybody is busy with their lives, and I understand. Nobody really asks me if I'm ""okay"" on a normal day, so it's honestly business as usual. 

I'm considered an essential worker right now in a field somewhat related to healthcare. There are seven body trucks outside the building I work in that get filled up every day. A big aspect of my job involves me dealing with death on a daily basis, but even this is starting to put me on edge. I wish I had friends or at least someone who could ask if I'm okay for a change.

fv5d06,Just a cry into the dark,"Hello everyone.

I'm not quite sure what I'm here for myself to be perfectly honest. I guess crippling loneliness is starting to break me to my core, and I feel the need to let out one final cry of anguish before shattering. I perfectly understand that reading me complain is not the most fun activity there is, so I promise I'll try my best to keep it short.

So for a bit of context, I'm a 25 years old male from France. Looking back at my childhood, I always displayed signs of ""higher than average intelligence"" (I always hate saying stuff like that, which is why I felt more comfortable using quotation marks, but more recent tests have made this ""official"" so it's not just some ego thing) and depression, among other, less noticeable things. But unlike me, who was always drawn to the complex, the unsettling, my family, friends and teachers were very simple people who did not see any of those signs. Of course this made me feel terrible, because having this kind of mind is horrible, but also because I never fit in anywhere. So I instinctively used my very high empathy to understand what people expected of me, and wore this permanent mask so close to my skin I forgot I was wearing it. In simpler words, I thought so much about the personalities I put on for others and felt them so deeply that I lost myself in them, and from a very young age, I forgot who I was, and at some point, even doubted I really existed as a person.

All of this went on during my teenage years. My deep pain kept getting stronger, no one was there to see it (I was instinctively hiding it, but was still desperately hoping that someone would see through the veil and notice it), still never fitting in anywhere. Finally, when I was 13, I decided to listen to my suicidal thoughts and tried to end it. My parents tried their best to understand why I would do this, but how could I explain it to them when I myself was so lost in my own mind that I didn't know who I was? So they decided to take me to a psychiatrist, which I, at first, wanted to avoid, but I secretly hoped she would see through all the smoke and find me.

She didn't. I tried my best to be perfectly honest with her, and all she diagnosed was some school-related stress (I've never been stressed by school). The despair I saw in my parents when they saw me after my try, combined with the relief when the psychiatrist told them it was stress, prompted me to keep hiding all this dark stuff from others and keep pretending I'm fine.

I had been desperately lonely my whole life, but it was around 14 or 15 that it started really getting to me. I would constantly fantasise about having someone care about me. Just look me in the eye and say ""It's okay, I'm here for you"", but not say it to one of those misty masks my mind made me wear, to me, the real me, the one that's hidden under all this clutter and crying for help. 

I said I would try to keep it short and I feel like I'm failing, so let me speed up a little. I got my first girlfriend when I was 16, but the relationship was short because she suddenly died of cancer after 3 months. It took some time to get over it, but since I didn't really have the time to open up and let her ""get to me"", to my heart, I was less devastated than one may think. Then, when I was 17, I got into my longest relationship yet, which lasted 1 year and 9 months. This was the closest I had ever gotten to feeling understood. I slowly let down my barriers, slowly let her dig through all the fake personalities that built up against my will, and saw me. And right as I felt seen, she left me out of the blue.

This time, I was truly devastated. I almost tried to end it again, but decided against it so she wouldn't feel guilty. After a few years, I went back to the dating scene, convinced that this deep desire for love that I had always had was the one thing that could help me out of this encroaching madness. (Of course, this is debatable, and I have known quite a lot of people who have told me that this was a stupid thing to believe in, but I still think it might be the only way.) I went through 13 relationships between 2014 and now, and every single time, I tried my best to open up my heart to the person who vowed to take care of it, and every single time, they broke it in a thousand pieces and kept one for themselves. Every time, I felt less emotions; less love, less grief. It broke me bit by bit. And here I am today, with a splintered heart that doesn't seem to be capable of working any more.

Even though I was a hypersensitive person who lived a life full of hurt and neglect, I always believed. I believed that happiness would come for me one day, and that in the meantime, I should try my best to make others happy. So I did, waiting, hoping. But I'm tired of barely hanging on. I'm tired of having no one care about me, or hug me, or kiss me in the morning. This kind of thing, as simple as they may seem, are what I live for. They are what I lived for.

I guess what I mean to say is, after 25 years of trying and trying, of turning the other cheek and doing everything I can to make the world a better place for others, I'm done. I'm done hoping. All of this is never going to happen. I'm not saying this to get comments telling me otherwise - I don't know why I'm writing all this, but it's definitely not attention-whoring. I truly believe that none of what I was hoping for is happening. So I give up. And as I'm writing this, I realise that this might be my last cry of anguish before I fade away.

I'm sorry for (probably) ruining your mood, but I just had to get it out of my system. Now that I now my feelings are out on the wind, I can sleep peacefully.

I have my own apartment, I have several consoles, a PC, a laptop, all of the streaming sites, drawing pads, etc. I have so much to keep myself entertained. But I'm so, so, so very disinterested in all of it. All I do is scroll on my phone on whatever social media, or I just sit in bed.

I have no genuine friends, no hobbies, no interests. I used to feel genuinely shy about talking to new people. But now, I just get very disinterested in talking to anyone, and fast. No one has kept my interest, and I've felt no urge to pursue a friendship with anyone. And anyone I used to be friends with, I feel like a bother and that they're just over me. I've just kind of accepted it. No one reaches out to me anymore. And I get ignored when I reach out to them. I feel no resentment towards them, they have their own lives.

The only reason I push myself to live everyday is for my dog and my cat. I've had my dog since she was 8 weeks old, and she's pushing 8 years now. I know she'll pass within the next couple years. And my cat is only 3 or 4 years (she was a stray), so I know she'll be around a little longer. 
I'm not actively suicidal. Part of me definitely doesn't want to exist because I don't feel terribly important, but the other part of me cares too deeply about how it would hurt my sister.

I have no motivation. I've had the same monotonous job for 4 years, and I don't care enough to do anything else. I'm also not terribly smart, so pursuing anything else is out of the question. I don't have what it takes to be a manager. I don't have a driver's license because I'm too scared to drive. 
I want to better my life. But I don't know how to, and at this point I'd just rather give up. Because no matter how much I stay positive, and try to keep a good mindset, something always sets me back to the point it gets harder and harder to keep pushing on. It feels pointless. I hardly feel emotions at all anymore. All I ever do is get angry or I just genuinely feel nothing.

I don't know what to do with myself anymore",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fv5s3p/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_myself_anymore/,ihatecherrys,1,2020-04-05 10:53:15,2,/r/lonely/comments/fv5s3p/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_myself_anymore/,NaN

fv63s0,"I broke, I feel so hopeless...","Maybe this isn’t the right subreddit for this but I’m just looking for any way to vent my complete hatred for what I’ve become, it’s almost unbearable...

I’m an essential employee of a retail business, this pandemic has done nothing but build stress and emotion that I just cannot begin to comprehend. I work over 40 brutal hours a week to help out because of how understaffed we are despite our high demands in our products like cleaning supplies or sanitation items. Everyone is either quarantined, sick, or fired from a recent scandal we had and it’s taken too much of a toll on my mental health. 

Yesterday, a customer asked me for a bag, I kindly handed it to her and then she threw it back at me while saying “This bag has a tear in it? Are you fucking kidding me?” I ignored her but then she went to my manager and asked kindly for a bag saying “You should learn to teach your cunt employee some respect.” Then my mind went blank and I lashed out. We exchanged vial words, I became a whole different person. It became this huge scene where the whole team and even cops were involved. Mostly to comfort me and tell me that she was a usual psycho and that I didn’t deserve that etc. 

I just feel so guilty about it. Not for her, I could care less for that person. But for how I became someone I thought I’d never be. It made me realize that I’m not okay but instead of reaching out for help. Help came to me in a form of heroism and reassurance. I was praised for putting her in my place instead of being reprimanded for my actions. Instead of being happy, I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness in grief for becoming something I wished to never become. I was even heard things like “SALEEM? He would never do something like that, no way I don’t believe it!” It made me realize how fragile my current mental state actually is and I’m scared. I don’t know how to reach out or who to talk to because I’m just seen as a hero when I feel like the villain to myself and my head. I feel so lost, so so lost. I don’t know what to do so I’m writing it out on the internet... ugh.....",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fv63s0/i_broke_i_feel_so_hopeless/,SupremeSaleem,1,2020-04-05 11:16:01,3,/r/lonely/comments/fv63s0/i_broke_i_feel_so_hopeless/,NaN

fv74up,Human touch,"I haven't been touched or kissed by anyone in so long I forget what it feels like. I've been single for 4 fucking years. 
At first it was by choice after having my heart broken too many times. I wanted to work on myself before I got back out there. I knew that the reason I kept attracting broken people was because I was broken. But the longer I stayed single, the further I sort of withdrew from wanting anyone touching me or even being near other people. I became basically a hermit, not going out, socializing or even on any dating apps.
I randomly met a guy about a year and a half ago and had a random drunken one night stand, which only made me feel like shit about myself and reminded me how much I don't want that kind of thing. 
I told myself I had nothing to offer anyone else. I made myself believe the negative self talk and eventually lost all sense of confidence and my self esteem went down the toilet. 
It's taken a lot of work and reflection and processing of trauma to get back to a place where I even want to date or have a relationship again. But it's been so long now that I don't even know how to open the door. 

I tried a couple dating apps and immediately regretted it and ended up deleting them. 
I feel like people are either too rude and pushy for sex right off the bat, or just don't have anything intelligent to talk about. 
Maybe I expect too much. 
Maybe my match is just on the other side of the world and we're never meant to meet. 
Maybe I already had all the love I'm ever gonna get and that's it for the rest of my life I'm just destined to be a lonely cat lady.

It’s like when ever my friends bring up the word marriage, I laugh to myself knowing that I probably would never experience it. I recently just turned 20 and I still have not had a serious relationship and only talk to maybe 2 guys and nothing serious happened with them. I ran out of all hope of this idea of me being in a relationship. When I imagine my future I imagine it as me being on my own, and just having enough money to support myself. Anyone else feel this way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fv93jm/the_future/,mmaarr1147,1,2020-04-05 15:10:54,1,/r/lonely/comments/fv93jm/the_future/,NaN

fv9b28,I seriously abused my ex boyfriend for years and then convinced everyone we knew I was the victim. I ruined his life and I regret it.," I can't bring myself to say exactly what I did, if someone did this to my Son, or even if someone had done it to my ex, I would instantly think murderous thoughts.

Inside of me I have an anger that never goes away, and a need for attention. Well, I've been drowning in online pity for something that didn't really happen for years, and not only that, what I did was worse.

I was deeply abusive and manipulative and it was something we talked about many times, there were good times when I was caring and loving and a good friend and other times when I felt miserable, bitter, and like I deserved more or deserved to aggressively justify my behavior. When our relationship ended it was my fault, it had always been my fault, but I was so angry I focused entirely on getting him in trouble. I even convinced myself that I was right for years.

I called the police and I was seriously afraid they would ask his side of the story, but they never did. I cost him his job with a protection order and slandered him to anyone that would let me, I slept around and had an attitude that I deserved this, I hated him, I justified it the same way every abuser does, by saying what I was doing was good because of how I felt I had been treated. In the back of my mind I hated myself, because nothing I felt was as good as his smile and his warmth and I knew it.

I had made a mistake and possibly ruined his life and there was no possibility of going back on it.

You guys I'm not even explaining this very well, but this Man made my life possible. I owe him everything. I am doing well entirely because of him. He was supportive in every way and he made me feel centered. I don't need him, so many people commented on how happy and lucky I was when we were together - none of them said a word to me about my accusations afterward. Everyone believed me or said nothing if they didn't, I even told people who had liked him how he was beneath me and they agreed. I have no respect for any of them, but I was addicted to their pity. I have been obsessed with posting online for attention of this for years.

I'm amazed at how many people see my behavior as empowering and not abusive, but not a single person has ever told me what I did was wrong. Eventually though, my attention began to dry up, and it was almost entirely Men who wanted me sexually. Instead of moving on this made me more bitter, toward men and toward my ex who was literally the only person I've ever known above this kind of basic male behavior. I began to divulge more 'details', which were lies, I reached out to others, joined communities. I never became happier. I began to consider what was really happening during therapy. My therapist guided me away from revenge and toward taking care of my anxiety and other mental health issues. I hated it at first, because it took me away from my obsession. But it was the right move. Over that summer I spent some time writing and exploring my positivity, something I had banned from my brain for years.

I remembered a lot of great memories and uncovered a lot of doubts about my own story. I've always known I was lying, because I'm careful about what I say to certain people like my therapist. I plan around it, but I spend so much energy on the lie that it felt true. Realizing that it wasn't hurt me. Realizing that I was hurting myself freed me, at least a little. I still haven't told anyone. I haven't told my therapist but I realize that I can because of client confidentiality. I don't think I can ever publicly admit that I exploited the law to hurt an innocent man. I don't ever think I can confess to his side of the story, even though I basically already did in our texts. There are influencers who have Retweeted me and basically vouched for me, even my work life is full of people who know about my story. To be honest though, there's a giddiness inside of me for the first time in forever. The kind of people who would be most upset about this were always the most full of shit.

I am a violent, cruel, vindictive domestic abuser. I used to wonder if the police would break down my door one day, or if someone would call me a liar in public. It never happened. If it had I would've stuck to my lies even more.

My ex is actually a good person who had an unfair burden on him that eventually made him distant and angry. You would not have done as good of a job as he did. Even the things he did that were wrong were understandable. I was never angry about it until I knew I couldn't have him. He stopped loving me. I know it. That's what made me angry.

I can't even say Sorry because I could end up going to jail or getting sued.

Don't do this. It's so easy to do, but don't ever pull this scam. Don't listen to women who tell you this is justice, don't get into those toxic groups that spend all days posting about how men are trash. Don't listen to people who think they're victims because of some petty shit no-one can even relate to. None of these women compare to that one man who made me happy for years.

I often think about who I want him to be with, and it reveals a lot about how I think. It's full of revenge fantasies and a desire to be right. I wanted him to abuse a woman so badly. I wanted him to be too broken to love again. I thought pure evil about him.

I'm really sorry. I needed your love so much I would've killed you for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fv9b28/i_seriously_abused_my_ex_boyfriend_for_years_and/,AwkwardAirport7,1,2020-04-05 15:30:13,3,/r/lonely/comments/fv9b28/i_seriously_abused_my_ex_boyfriend_for_years_and/,NaN

fv9uxc,First time here. This lockdown made me reflect more and I realised that I'm just a low self-esteem and lonely guy. Kinda need to talk to someone.,"I'm 18 and this lockdown has made me reflect on my relatively short life. I've never really had a relationship with anyone and a don't have any true friends, just people I know who just want to go drinking somewhere. But the worst thing is that I never had emotional intimacy with anyone yet I'm a very emotional person and I feel that I need to share that emotion with someone. I'm a big introvert which sets me apart from most people I know and they always point it out in one way or another. They have all either had girfriends or still do and I feel like I'm missing out. The problem is i overthink almost every sentence with people and that stops me from having enjoyable converastions. The most emotional connection I have had outside of my family, is my aunt's dog. This bring me to another thing. For a few months now I have been talking to this girl. And she is the first person to ever really compliment me on soo many things and it really means a lot when all people have been telling you is ""c'mon man you gotta lose your virginity"". Starting to think that, eventually, I'm gonna catch feelings for her which for me is pretty much a first. No experience in relationships really so the possibility of me falling in love kinda stresses me out because I don't know if I will be good enough. Anyway, my general problem is that i have never had real emotional connection or support from anyone and that hurts soo much when I reflect upon it all. I have no idea for how much longer  this will go on, I'm really hoping that i might be able to pull something off with this girl, but what if I don't and I am just forced to live my life alone for who knows how many more years. I'm just scared of the future I guess. About a year ago I was depressed but I eventually made it out, however, now it's comig back and I have no one to turn to so here I am, on old Reddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fv9uxc/first_time_here_this_lockdown_made_me_reflect/,tkeser4,1,2020-04-05 16:22:24,10,/r/lonely/comments/fv9uxc/first_time_here_this_lockdown_made_me_reflect/,NaN
fva0a4,I feel really broken and want someone to talk to about it,"
I'm 26. ive never had sex. Ive only been in one realtionship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperinced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect .when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I litterally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty  womans voice tell me im not a horrible digusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself. 

in a perfect world I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embaressment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMLY kind and caring towards me without being condesnding, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fva0a4/i_feel_really_broken_and_want_someone_to_talk_to/,Lonelyconversation1,1,2020-04-05 16:36:39,6,/r/lonely/comments/fva0a4/i_feel_really_broken_and_want_someone_to_talk_to/,NaN

fva4sw,Severely losing motivation again,"I don’t know what it is but I am struggling to care again. I am graduating college in one month with my bachelors in Cybersecurity and minor in Management Information Systems. It’s a good degree to have that will get me a well paying job and just graduating college itself is an achievement that should be celebrated but I have zero emotions towards it. This should be a monumental time in my life and I just do not care. I have no motivation to care about classes or continue applying for jobs for when I graduate because everything feels pointless. 

No matter what I do I always come back to thinking about my loneliness. It’s so hard to distract myself from it now. When I hang out with friends or play video games or go skating the thoughts are still there. They’re in the back of my head or they’re at the forefront and the only thing I can focus on. I’m 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship before. I have plenty of friends, some I am closer to than others. I’ve talked with them about how I feel and they say I’m not a bad looking guy and I have a great personality so it’ll only take time but it is hard for me to believe them. 

I’ve been wanting to be in a relationship since the middle of high school so at least 6 years now and I really didn’t think I would graduate college without having been in one. It’s hard for me to see all of my friends go in and out of relationships over the years. Some of my best friends are in long term relationships and one is even talking about getting married soon. I feel like an outcast in the dating world. I feel rejected and unloved. I’m reminded of this everything I see my friends with their significant others. I wish that I had someone to spend time with. I want to hold hands, go to the movies, get fast food at 1am, or just go to the grocery store with someone. I want to come home and tell someone about my day and hear about theirs. 

I feel like this will never happen. I feel like nobody will every love me. I was bullied pretty bad in high school and I haven’t fully gotten over that yet even 4 years later. I have some slight self confidence issues because of that which is also why I find it hard to believe one people say I’m not that bad looking. Sometimes I will look in the mirror and it will ruin my day. I go through periods of feeling like a normal person but also times when I feel very depressed. I feel myself slipping back into a depression again. All of this being inside now has caused me to lose hope of meeting someone anytime soon. 

Life is seeming more pointless by the day. I don’t want to live my life alone anymore. My heart aches for someone to love me. I don’t understand why it is so hard to find someone unless I am the problem. If that’s the case I should just end it all because I have no desire to live a life of solitude. 

This has been a bit all over the place and longer than I expected so my apologies.

fvaoyq,recovery is lonely. i miss him a lot. venting,"tw: csa, abuse

i was in an abusive relationship when i was a young teen. like really, young. im a little older now. a little wiser but stil just as empty. 

he made me feel loneliness. i never felt it beforehand. i’ll be honest. i was going into my freshman year when i met him online. it was simple at first. then threats, then he disappeared, then he came back, then he cheated, then threats again, then insults, etc... it was very tumultuous for me. i had always wanted a relationship because my friends had them. and i never did. i felt undesirable. i was young. i didnt need to be desirable. 

shortly before our breakup i was raped multiple times by a man and my bf said i cheated. i never ever felt so sad in my life. i never felt so alone. few people know this happened. 

i dealt with this relationship after years of sexual abuse online, i get sad because i feel like pictures of me from when i was young are still being passed around. nobody knows this happened to me. 

i was raped again. sophomore year, two different men. i try to block it out. it hurts a lot but it feels good to say. and get it out. 

i lost one of my best friends after the assaults because i kept taking my anger and frustration out on her. i wish i could apologize to her and be honest. we had valid reasons to stop being friends, like, i had reason to be mad at her. but it mostly came from frustration i had within myself. i know this now.

i was with a boy who meant a lot to me for a little bit. i opened up to him about my rapes. and i feel like it made him see me differently. i always let my guard down around him because i felt safe, really safe. like i didnt need to be scared or sad. i had him. i could kiss him and hold his hand or text him when i felt afraid. i liked that a lot. he had a hard time opening up to me, it made me sad because i felt like we had an emotional connection. i know he had been hurt too before. i am not sure in what ways exactly, but i know he had been hurt. i never pressured him to open up because i know what its like to not want to speak up. i know its scary to accept what happened. 

we broke up shortly after his dog died. he was devastated. and it might be funny on the outside but a lot of people have pets that act as emotional support. he was mostly together up until that point. i assume something else happened, i dont know. but it makes me sad knowing he was loosely stitched together until he lost his support system. he was an alcoholic and a really depressed, insecure guy. and all i wanted to do was hold him and make things okay. i wanted to be able to support him. maybe i couldnt give him what he had before, but i wanted him to have something. he deserved more. we both deserved more. 

and after we broke up i saw him on tinder. and i was devastated. and i messaged him and i told him how hurt i was. i felt lied to. and pathetic. and i feel really pathetic for being mad at him too, i was on tinder too. but i just felt so betrayed after he said he couldnt be with anyone. 

and then i messaged him again a few weeks ago. after no contact for months. no response. 

last night i felt really lonely again so i downloaded tinder after months of being single. i usually try to hop around (like i did shortly after we broke up, but no one felt right. im bi and i couldnt even feel right around other girls. i felt fucked.) but i couldnt this time. 

ive been single for 5 months. just working on myself. i downloaded tinder for attention, really. i wanted to feel wanted. and im attracted to nobody on the app. i swipe and i see him again. my heart drops just like it did when i saw him on our first date. and i just look at his pictures and wish i was looking into his eyes instead. and i just feel very very sad. 

this was a boy i had true feelings for. and i think he gave me the wakeup call that i need to work on myself. its sad but its true. he said there are times when he feels like neither of us are ready. he was right. i wasnt. i needed time to grow. and i think im realizing my worth now. im still really alone and sad. but i know more of what i deserve, i guess. 

and i think about him a lot less obsessively now. sometimes he catches my mind, but its never excruciating thoughts like before. i feel like i think about him a normal amount now. i guess. i dont know. how am i still thinking about a guy i havent spoken to in nearly 5 months? i dont know. i couldnt tell if i loved him, i feel like i do love him. i wish i couldve told him that, but things were so hard for us as individuals. it felt like our safe space was with each other. we could just be our soft selves and touch each other emotionally and physically. 

i wish i couldve cried in his arms at least once. i dont know why, but i do. he smelled so sweet and his touch was so soft. whenever he hugged me it was so innocent and like, i never felt scared or unsafe. i feel very uncomfortable about men usually unless its my best friend. 

but this boy, i feel like i overcame a lot just being with him. i learned a lot. i guess i always felt like i’d be a victim of my trauma until i met him and i realize i can love and be loved. it doesnt have to be all pain. and yes it hurt when he left, a fucking lot. it still hurts. and all i want to do is be with him. but i always feel like i messed up somewhere. and we both had our faults. and im not hard on him for his faults, shit, i forgave him. but i cant forgive myself for something im not even sure i did. i dont know. 

i admit i want to be with him again after having some time to grow on my own. is this right? i dont know. love is always intense, ive realized. and that can be a good or a bad thing. 

i would do anything to hold him again and hear him say my name. and kiss his nose. and just sit in silence with him.  

i just wanna let him know how i feel. and if i could, i would tell him i love him and that im sorry we couldnt be together. and that im not mad at him for leaving me and he did the right thing. 

right now, i am recovering from everything thats happened to me at once. its hard. its lonely. but i needed it. i needed this break from trying to force someone else to be with me. i need to love me more. and do better. and i am making baby steps. but i do think im doing well. im still very sad and alone but for other reasons. 

he always told me he feared us hating each other and i hope he does not think that is whats happening now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fvaoyq/recovery_is_lonely_i_miss_him_a_lot_venting/,lonelycandle1,1,2020-04-05 17:43:43,6,/r/lonely/comments/fvaoyq/recovery_is_lonely_i_miss_him_a_lot_venting/,NaN

fvbe8o,Feeling loneliness in my chest,"Anyone else feel this way ?
Sometimes I feel overwhelmingly lonely, and sometimes I actually feel it in my heart, like almost physically.

fvbfyb,I cried this morning,"I have not cried in about a year, this morning was rough for me. I had a dream where this girl I knew from a long time ago was running her fingers up and down my arm and I woke up and felt awful. Touch and words of affirmation are my love languege. Something I don't get from my family who have been cruel and something I can't expect at my job as a cook. It's been a really long time since I've gotten a hug.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fvbfyb/i_cried_this_morning/,IronTydes,1,2020-04-05 18:59:05,31,/r/lonely/comments/fvbfyb/i_cried_this_morning/,NaN
fvblpj,Idk it’s 5AM and I’m stressed,Hi I’m 17f and a hs senior. At the moment I’m just overwhelmed with school. I do college courses even tho I’m in high school and it’s really stressful. They’ve been assigning me sooo many things. In fact I have a 14 page lab due by midnight. I just don’t have the motivation to do anything. And what’s REALLY stressing me out is that I didn’t get accepted to the college they hoped for me to go to. I want to tell them I want to take a gap year to work and focus on my art. You see I want to be a storyboard artist and I don’t have a portfolio at all because I’ve been busy these past two years and a gap year would really help.Also I can’t really vent to my friends because they have a lot going on right now too. This virus really messed up my life. Since my friends are busy we can’t talk. When I’m on an online lecture they wanna FaceTime but when I’m feeling like shit at like 7pm they’re busy doing homework and idk. I know I have friends but it feels really lonely when you have no one to talk to. But I don’t wanna be that girl just being like “hey can we talk” cause they’ll feel bad and that not what I want. I wish they could start a conversation with me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fvblpj/idk_its_5am_and_im_stressed/,Kimberly_tgre,1,2020-04-05 19:14:19,3,/r/lonely/comments/fvblpj/idk_its_5am_and_im_stressed/,NaN
fvbxqh,I can barely close my eyes without seeing their face.,"I loved them so much and they just, left me again.
I dont even know what i did, they said i did nothing but i must have done something.

People dont change their mind like that over nothing.

People dont fall out of love over nothing.


I miss them so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fvbxqh/i_can_barely_close_my_eyes_without_seeing_their/,TheFearlessFrog,1,2020-04-05 19:46:41,5,/r/lonely/comments/fvbxqh/i_can_barely_close_my_eyes_without_seeing_their/,NaN

fvce8u,My first ever poem,"I don't know If this is the right place to post this and I don't know if this is worthy of being called a poem even,  but while writing it on an impulse I'm sure to have felt myself astranged and cut-off from outside. I dedicate this to all my friends here. I bet this storm will also pass and a new beginning in an unknown beautiful land awaits all of us.

*Oh heavenly peeps*

*I ask no more*

*Just your love and embrace*

*to keep my ship stay afloat*

*In these perilous times of distress and gloom*

*When the darkish waters swallows me up whole*

*When the winds of despair drives me off course*

fvcg9b,Life goes on,"It had been 3 years since I saw the only person who I have loved. I was driving and I saw you in a car with your man.  I was at work when I saw you, i was out on a delivery. All the emotions I had for you came back when I saw you,  you didn't notice me but I saw you. And I'm not gonna lie it took everything I had in my heart to not cry and say ""fuck this job""and go home.  I was holding back tears for the rest of my shift. Some tears did get out, to be honest. I just can't believe I saw you again. I've dream about this girl 4 times this year alone. I thought you were not in my mind any more but you still are and I haven't gotten over you.  Seeing you today was such a terrible thing for me, becuase not only did I confirm I'm not over you,  I'm more sad now becuase of it.  But hey life goes on,  what can you do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fvcg9b/life_goes_on/,rx9ue,1,2020-04-05 20:34:57,0,/r/lonely/comments/fvcg9b/life_goes_on/,NaN
fvclij,Anyone?,"Who else feels like everyone will abandon them eventually or even after a very short time? 

I don’t have any significant disorders other than Anxiety/Social Anxiety but it’s a huge deal with me. In college I’ve probably lost way more people than I have gained and have had very short term friendships/“relationships.” 

I wouldn’t say I am an awful person, I make bad decisions and mistakes sometimes like everyone. I am a bit goofy and silly, not the most attractive looking 20-something woman but I think I have a lot to offer someone. Yet they are always very temporary in my life and I’ve never made a long term friend or have ever had a long term relationship (they only ever last about 2 months, hardly can call it a relationship). 

I feel like I’m easy to mistreat? I’ve been emotionally abused by guys like have had nasty things said about my body. I have had friends lie to me to “protect” my feelings and also was made fun of by pretty girls and cute guys when I was a kid all through high school. I try not to let that define me but I also feel like my abandonment by others has been set up from childhood. Anyone else feel like I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/fvclij/anyone/,Tayler_Vengenz,1,2020-04-05 20:48:31,4,/r/lonely/comments/fvclij/anyone/,NaN
